<p><u>Context:</u> <context>You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. He has proposed to set up two aid stations to help victims of a natural distaster, one American and one Chinese. You think it would be better to have one large American aid station because your medics have better training.</context></p>
