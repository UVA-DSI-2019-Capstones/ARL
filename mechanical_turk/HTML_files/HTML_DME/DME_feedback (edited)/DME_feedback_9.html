<p><u>Context:</u> <context>You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. He has just told you that planes carrying equiptment for the Chinese team have been delayed, and unless the planes arrive, his team may not be able to help. You try to convince him to help you and have told him that you will go to a higher ranked officer if he does not help, but he says it is out of his control. You want to convince him that it is better to cooperate than to make you go to a higher ranked officer.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> You are the American soldier. Please provide a response in your own words from the perspective of the American soldier that you feel matches the feedback above each text box, and also:</p>
