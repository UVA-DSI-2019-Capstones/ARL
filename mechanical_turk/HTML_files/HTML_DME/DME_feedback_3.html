<p><u>Context:</u> You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. <context>Upon meeting the commander of the Chinese team for the first time, he looks slightly discouraged when he sees your rank. He proceeds to ask where your commader, the man he organized your mission, is and why he isn't present. Your boss can't make it because he had unexpected business.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> You are the American soldier. Please provide a response in your own words from the perspective of the American soldier that you feel matches the feedback above each text box, and also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
