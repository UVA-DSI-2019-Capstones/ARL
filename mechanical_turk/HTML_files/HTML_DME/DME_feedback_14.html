<p><u>Context:</u> You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. <context>Upon meeting the commander of the Chinese team for the first time, he looks slightly discouraged when he sees your rank. You explain that you have taken the place of your commander because he had unexpected business come up. He has proposed to set up two aid stations to help victims of a natural distaster, one American and one Chinese. You think it would be better to have one large American aid station because your medics have better training.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> You are the American soldier. Please provide a response in your own words from the perspective of the American soldier that you feel matches the feedback above each text box, and also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
