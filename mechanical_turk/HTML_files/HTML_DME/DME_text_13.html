<p><u>Context:</u> You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. <context>Upon meeting the commander of the Chinese team for the first time, he looks slightly discouraged when he sees your rank. You explain that you have taken the place of your commander because he had unexpected business come up. He has proposed to set up two aid stations to help victims of a natural distaster, one American and one Chinese. You think it would be better to have one large American aid station because your medics have better training.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please re-word the following prompts in your own words. While doing so, please also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the meaning of the prompt.</li>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
