<p><u>Context:</u> You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. <context>Upon meeting the commander of the Chinese team for the first time, he looks slightly discouraged when he sees your rank. You explain that you have taken the place of your commander because he had unexpected business come up. The Chinese commander is not asking you for information on the type of supplies that you have brought for the mission. You tell him, you want to wait until the meeting this afternoon to talk about it. He tells you that knowing some basic information now would be helpful.</context></p>
