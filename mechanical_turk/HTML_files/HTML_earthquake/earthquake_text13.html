<p><u>Context:</u> <context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. A US sergeant (lower rank than you) is arguing with a Chinese Lieutenant. You are frusterated that they are arguing rather than working to help the victims of the earthquake. You handle the situation, but the US sergeant asks you to talk to the Chinese Lieutenant about why he would not cooperate previously. You tell the Chinese Lieutenant that your sergeant is in charge when you are not around, and that he needs to be treated respectfully. The Chinese Lieutenant apologizes and says it will not happen again.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please re-word the following prompts in your own words. While doing so, please also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the meaning of the prompt.</li>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
</ul>
