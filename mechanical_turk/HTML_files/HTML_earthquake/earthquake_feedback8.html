<p><u>Context:</u><context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. You are heading to epicenter of the earthquake, but you have just received word that there is a much denser concentration of casualties in the city of Arusha than at the epicenter. You are going to change course and head to Arusha. The head of the Chinese team has stated that he needs to get approval from his superiors to change course. You need to hurry to make it there in time, so you want to tell him that you understand but need to act quickly. </context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please provide a response in your own words that matches the feedback that is above each text box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
