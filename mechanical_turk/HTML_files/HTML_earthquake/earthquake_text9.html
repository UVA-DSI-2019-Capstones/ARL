<p><u>Context:</u> <context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. You are heading to epicenter of the earthquake, but you have just received word that there is a much denser concentration of casualties in the city of Arusha than at the epicenter. You are going to change course and head to Arusha. The head of the Chinese team has stated that he needs to get approval from his superiors to change course. You need to hurry to make it there in time, so you want to tell him that you understand but need to act quickly. He has not heard from his superiors in five minutes, so you want to continue without him.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please re-word the following prompts in your own words. While doing so, please also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the meaning of the prompt.</li>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
