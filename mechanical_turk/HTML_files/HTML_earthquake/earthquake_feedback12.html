<p><u>Context:</u><context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. A US sergeant (lower rank than you) is arguing with a Chinese Lieutenant. You are frusterated that they are arguing rather than working to help the victims of the earthquake. You handle the situation, but the US sergeant asks you to talk to the Chinese Lieutenant about why he would not cooperate previously. You feel the way the sergeant was treated was inappropriate. </context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please provide a response in your own words that matches the feedback that is above each text box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>

Overall tone is very calm and understanding.</label35><input class="form-control" name="Q5FreeTextInput" size="120" type="text"/><label36>This option is the least sensitive, with an incredulous tone found throughout. Not only does the user disparage the PLA officer, but also his own platoon sergeant, berating the Chinese officer for not being able to work a solution out.</label36><input class="form-control" name="Q5FreeTextInput" size="120" type="text"/><label37>This response subtly refutes what the PLA officer says and in a "jabbing" sort of way shames the officer for not taking on the role of partner seriously.</label37><input class="form-control" name="Q5FreeTextInput" size="120" type="text"/><label38>This response address the issue plainly but also acknowledges frustrations that the PLA officer faced (displaying empathy). The last line firmly but without venom sets the culture for the future.</label38><input class="form-control" name="Q5FreeTextInput" size="120" type="text"/><label39>By only saying thank you and that Sergeant Dortenzo will appreciate it the user completely neglects any blame that he may have in the situation, real or otherwise.</label39><input class="form-control" name="Q5FreeTextInput" size="120" type="text"/></div>
