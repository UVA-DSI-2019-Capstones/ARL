<p><u>Context:</u> <context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. A US sergeant (lower rank than you) is arguing with a Chinese Lieutenant. You are frusterated that they are arguing rather than working to help the victims of the earthquake. You handle the situation, but you want to talk to the Chinese Lieutenant about why he would not cooperate with the American sergeant. You feel the way the sergeant was treated was inappropriate.</context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please re-word the following prompts in your own words. While doing so, please also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the meaning of the prompt.</li>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
</ul>
