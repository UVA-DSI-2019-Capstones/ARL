<p><u>Context:</u><context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. You want to tell the Chinese team leader about the mission plans, but are busy, so you ask the Chinese medic to report them to the Chinese team leader. The Chinese team leader is upset that you did not report directly to him. He tells you that enlisted soldiers should not be entrusted with mission plans. You want to apologize for the misunderstanding in how to handle this type of situation. </context></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> Please provide a response in your own words that matches the feedback that is above each text box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to match the tone of the prompt.</li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.</li>
