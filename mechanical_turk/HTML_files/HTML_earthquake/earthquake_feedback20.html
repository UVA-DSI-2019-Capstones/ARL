<p><u>Context:</u><context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to pass out supplies to earthquake survivors. The US team has taken change of the aid station where the supplies are being distrubuted. The Chinese team shows up and begins passing out supplies. They are handing supplies out haphazardly and do not seem to care if everyone is getting equal supplies. They want to look good on camera. You feel your team should hand out supplies becuase you are in contorl of the aid station. You have asked the Chinese team leader to have his team pack supplies, but he says he wants to be treated equally in the mission. He has threatened to leave if you do not let his team hand out supplies. You do not want him to leave because it will hurt the mission. </context></p>
