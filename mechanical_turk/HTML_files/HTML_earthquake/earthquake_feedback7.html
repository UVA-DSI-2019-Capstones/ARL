<p><u>Context:</u><context> You are a US military officer working cooperatively with the Chinese military to aid earthquake survivors. You are heading to epicenter of the earthquake, but you have just received word that there is a much denser concentration of casualties in the city of Arusha than at the epicenter. You are going to change course and head to Arusha. The head of the Chinese team has stated that he may change course, but can't do so right away. You want to ask him why he wouldn't be able to come. </context></p>
