You have asked the Chinese team leader to have his team pack supplies, but he says he wants to be treated equally in the mission. He has threatened to leave if you do not let his team hand out supplies. You do not want him to leave because it will hurt the mission.</context></p>
<p><u><b>Intent:</b></u> <intent>You don't want the Chinese captain to leave because it would hurt the mission.

You can either apologize and ask him to stay, try to get him to stay by explaining that if he leaves it will hurt the mission, or offer to allow his team to pass out water and pack supplies as a compromise.</intent></p>
