<p><u><b>Context:</b></u> You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. <context>You are an American soldier who is meeting with the commander of a Chinese army platoon to discuss important business. He has proposed to set up two aid stations to help refugees, one American and one Chinese. You think it would be better to have one large American aid station with American medics, so you ask what benefit his plan has.</context></p>
<p><u><b>Intent:</b></u> <intent>You don't understand what benefit his method has because he will be spliting up the supplies, so refugees won't be able to get everything at one place. You could directly express this concern, or explain again that your plan was to use one aid station with American medics, and ask him how his plan is better. </intent></p>
<p><u>Your instructions, given that context:</u> You are the American soldier. Please provide a response in your own words from the perspective of the American soldier that you feel matches the feedback above each text box.</p>
