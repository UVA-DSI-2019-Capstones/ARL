20,Text,0,0,0,"A: hello come in. Why do you want to talk with me today ? Is that anything important ?/nT: Oh, yeah, um, it's, good to see you, too. I want to talk to you about our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be and i want to discuss with you how we could improve that. /nA: Sure, I’m open to any feedback/nT: I feel like i know i understand that you've been very busy getting ready for graduation um but it would be great if you could help us pull more weight with the final project especially being a senior, I think you would have a lot of insight that you could offer us/nA:  yeah, actually I have worked hard for the classes for years to get a relatively high i have i think my expertise help us to make this project better and uh that’s why I am also assigned to be the leader of the project but as you know that i'm going to graduate and i am applying to different graduate programs in different cities so i make i may be frequent out of town so i can't make sure that's how much time i can devote into this project /nT: uh well i feel like if you were assigned senior leader than that gives you a lot of responsibility that you still have to uphold even though you're about to graduate but it's the final stretch and it's not really fair to the other people that are in the group if you don't pull your weight as well so if you could just continue coming to meetings and responding to everybody else's messages about it just so that way we could get it done to the best of our ability and we really need someone to coordinate it all so i understand you have a lot to do but and it's just if the final stretch so you have to help us put in the last of work for it. /nA: Yeah, i like to help, and we can have become some meetings to discuss about it, and i can assign each member of our team’s work, since I am not usually at as the university. So i'm afraid i can not be present at every meeting of our team. So maybe we can try to try other ways of Communicating with each other within the group. For example, maybe I can create some google docs online, and again, we can make some modification. And if you guys want to have some meeting. You can meet first, and then report your conclusion to me If i have time I will try to view it /nT: Um, yeah, well, um, yeah, if you, like, went through, made like, an itinerary, something like that just so that we're on the same page. Or just emails to coordinate it, that would be good, Um, but just as much time as you can give for it. For, like before the project’s submitted or something like that. It's, like we would definitely to have a meeting before then. So. But as long as we're all on the same page with the information that we need. /nA: And that's let's discuss about the details, we are required to submit a three thousand word paper and maybe for the five members of our group i can see that if we set it equal each one will that the responsibility to write about six hundred words and but since i have limited time what about i just take five hundred and the rest of you take the rest of the two thousand five hundred words /nT: no if we're gonna divide it equally, we should divided equally between everyone i mean everyone it's like final season everyone has a lot of work going for them it's just like a matter of budgeting each of our time and i'm sorry that it’s difficult um but it's just not really fair to everybody else to put more on their plate but we can still like email back and forth like that or meet as a group if you need help writing it but it just wouldn't be fair if other people take more words to write/nA:  yeah I also understand that i can do this it's equal part of the work but since i cannot devote so much time having that if i if i also do that the six hundred words work  I may not  guarantee the quality of my part of work /nT: well as long as you do the six hundred words, it's like all of everyone divided up equally then we can go through and help you edit it and we can all work on editing everyone’s parts together. So /nA: so you mean everyone of my team can help me to edit my version of work, to get, get a better overall score right? /nT: Yeah, yeah, so long as everyone is doing to the same amount of work. You help each other edit it /nA: Yeah. Oh, he's. Sure, it makes sense. We can meet with each group is a group member tomorrow for lunch together for a discussion about that. /nT: Ok sounds good/nA: Thank you.","A: Hello, how's it going? What do you want to talk to me about? It sounds important./nT: Well, it's, good to see you. I want to talk about our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that./nA: This class is really important for me to graduate. /nT:  know you're really busy with very graduation. But it'll be great to get help, accomplishing tasks. Being a senior, your expertise go would really go a long way in helping us finish this project. /nA: Yeah, i know what you are saying. I also want to do well on this project. /nT: I haven't seen you being in a while and it's hard to keep up with project, because the full team hasn't been there. /nA: I’m busy with graduation and applying for grad school. /nT: so when do you think you'll be able to be available for the meetings? At what point in time?/nA: You can appoint some time. If I am available at that time I will participate. /nT: do you think it be possible for you to do your portion of the essay beforehand and then not attend the meetings we could build up what you already have/nA:  yeah sure i will appreciate yeah/nT:  because as you know like a lot of our the paper has been written by the same kind of voice so if you being a senior have more expertise would start the essay we could build up what you have in trying to write in the same voice /nA: yeah sure but uh as far as i have as i don't have so much time so what i would appreciate it if you don't assign too much work for me/nT: okay that that's the case would be possible to ask the professor for extension? you asked a lot of questions in class are very attentive so i think you'd be very receptive to you asking for extension specifically /nA: I have nearly fulfilled the requirements for graduation, but perfection is not my goal. /nT: it would really help developing us since we're only sophomores, we don't really know too much about the class. You have to excel well since you’re applying for graduate schools, your very bright future ahead of you, you have experience and the expertise, so you putting in some work, it kind of guiding us really help was a long run, trying to get us to where you are today. /nA: Yeah, I can help. I can give direction, but I may not be able to do a large amount of practical work. /nT: Well, there's, a three-thousand-word paper and there's four of us total, so How many words do you think you'd be able to do? /nA: Five hundred, /nT: five hundred? Wouldn’t about eight hundred about right, it’s only three hundred more words, it’s like half a page maybe/nA: In that case, I may not guarantee the quality of my parts. /nT: Why is that?/nA: In order to do good work, I have to work for a long time on it. With less work, I can focus more on making it higher quality./nT: could you do the five hundred words, and then you ask for an extension and finish the rest of the work afterwards, after you know, applying to schools ? /nA: Yeah, sure, yeah. /nT: Okay, great. So sounds like a compromise. /nA: Yeah, sounds good, thank you","A: What did you want to talk to me about today, is it important?/nT: yeah i just wanted to talk to you a little bit about how our group projects going because i feel like we're not where we need to be right now and i was wondering if you could have a conversation about that/nA: What do you want to discuss? /nT: myself and the other group members have known noticed that you haven't been as involved lately with the group and we were just thinking that since you are the senior and the other ones of us are a little bit more of the younger grades were wondering if we could use your expertise for the project to really help us guide and get where we need to be going /nA: I have worked hard and I have a lot of experience, but I am busy because I am applying to grad school, so I do not have much time. /nT: yeah i understand it must be really busy time for you i know graduation is coming up and that's very stressful but i think the least that we could ask right now is that the time that you do come to the projects if you could just give us your undivided attention during that time instead of maybe using your phone or something. /nA: I cannot guarantee I will be able to be in the meetings all the time, but I can communicate by phone. /nT: so you're saying that you would be available by phone if we need you for outside of the group time that we meet for, /nA: uh, yeah, i think we can. But if you cannot contact me, you can email me a list of the things you want me to do /nT: Yeah, i know it's, just like a lot of work that we're all dealing with. And we just wanted to kind of make sure, first of all, that we're all distributing the work evenly, but also that we can count on you for you to help us as the team leader in this project. /nA: I know you want to do well in the courses, but I have done quite well, so it is not that important for me to do really well. But I may not be able to take an equal amount of work. /nT: I think as long as i see where, what you're saying that you can't take the same amount of work. But this project is really important to all of us. And i know you understand that. But we would really appreciate if you, if you did, like, give it your all even if you take a smaller chunk of the work, if you could give that your attention/nA: sure, we can discuss about that.",0,"A: Hi how are you doing, you want to talk about something with me?/nT: yeah i'm doing all right i was just wondering if we could talk about a group project actually the group is just noticed you are a little busy with other things being a senior and we kind of had to bare a little more work so we're just wondering if we could do something about that /nA: What specifically?/nT: in specific you're late to a lot of our group meetings that we all try and show up to and make a group effort on the project we're falling behind because we don't have everyone on board on the same level and when you do show up you're often on your phone which is a little bit distracting to the rest of us i don't want to be mean but /nA: I am going to graduate soon, and I am applying for new schools, but time is really limited on my side. /nT: i understand that's perfectly understandable i get that it's very stressful being a senior and trying to apply to another school i'll get that we're just wondering if there's any way like maybe trying to be more punctual coming to the group meetings and you know when you're there just give us your full attention just so we can really knock it out when we have the time together and we can try and make make times that maybe are more adaptable to your schedule /nA: Do you have to be present every time we have group meetings?/nT: yes, that would be the best way to go about it because i mean, unless you have other stuff that's going on we understand if you have to do something else, take a test do other work priorities are priorities but as long as you can come when you do we just hope that you're not on your phone texting or anything like that just working directly with us on the group project/nA: Would you like to be the leader, and I can review things. /nT: i believe i certainly could take leadership from you if that's what you'd like to do and you can play more of a role a reviewer i think in that case it's still essential that you are present you know you're still there to be accountable for everything that goes on but that would definitely relieve you of a lot of the weight i put a little bit more on me that definitely be a nice compromise but we still we still definitely need you as a group member because you are a senior so your about your very valuable to our project /nA: Thank you for saying that. I could use skype instead of being present at every meeting. /nT: skype would definitely work if you had to skype in if you just couldn't make it in person as long as you're skyping and you hear what we're saying everyone's like president actively listening and working together that would be perfectly fine /nA: I could review everyone’s work and give suggestions. /nT: okay so you so you have done this project /nA: No, but I can give you some suggestions, because I have similar experience. /nT:i think it would be okay in the end we still definitely need you can't just be the review erbecause that's more of the role of the teacher but as long as you give us at least some input and that's a huge thing like if you're directing us you're giving us ideas if you're the idea of men and we do like work for you, that's, perfectly fine, we can take that kind of roll but we certainly need someone with the experience of a senior. We don't just need a reviewer and a suggester, we need someone to be actively participating in the project, just so it's balanced, because if it does, all wind up on me. That leaves a sophomore who's relatively in experience, in this case, just at the head of everything and thinking of everything, and i might miss something that you wouldn’t/nA: That is a fair solution, I can give you suggestion based on my experience./nT: Thank you","A: Hi you said you wanted to meet today, it sounded import./nT: yeah hi one i just wanted to talk to you about a group project um so i noticed that lately we've been having some kind of um unequitable shares going on in the group and i just wanted to talk to you about like what you thought your expectations are for the group project /nA: I am a senior and I am going to graduate soon, so I am really busy, so the school is not so important. /nT: What’s your dissertation on?/nA: Systems engineering. /nT:  Systems engineering oh, are you really interested in that /nA: Yeah Professor is /nT: nice so you really care about that class right and how you doing, /nA: Yes, but I am really more focused on my dissertation. /nT: right, right. Okay. Um well, i just want to talk about the group project i know you're really interested in your dissertation and it sounds really interesting, but i just noticed that a lot of the rest of the group members have been not during like, more of the work than you have, but um also you've been, like kind of showing up late to things, and, uh, when you do that, it makes us feel more stressed about the work that we have to do for the project. And we're not really i'm coming to you now because i just want to put everything out there. So that way, you don't feel like we're resenting you behind your back or anything like that. We just want to lay everything out on the table. And, um, i just want to let you know how i'm feeling about it and personally, like, i'm feeling pretty stressed, because when you come for meetings late and you're on your phone, and i don't feel like you're really participating it's hard, because then we have to do the work that you're not doing. So how do you feel about that ? /nA: First of all, i'm sorry for letting you feel stressful. I know this course is important to you and other team members. i'm really likely to help you with the projects as i've said i have to make experience doing such projects so i think if you have any problem or a question on the project can ask me/nT: great okay thank you so what i'm hearing you say is that you are completely willing to help us work on the project and you're really busy with your dissertation but you can you want to help in any way you can and that's like that's i know that for me and my group members that's all we care about is just having you be able to be around so i think going forward with those expectations that'll be good because then we can kind of we can adjust like your schedule since we don't want you to show up to our meetings and not have you pay attention and waste your time and also our time so maybe we could think of like uh a way that you could show up to our meetings like once a week and we could have questions prepared for you so that way we're making the most of our time and being the most efficient with our time and not wasting yours /nA: Making things efficient would be helpful. Maybe you could be a leader, that would be good experience for you. /nT: yeah and if we could like we could designate like a weekly like officer or something like that so everyone could rotate and leadership positions and um like working on what we have to present that week for the project and making sure that you are on the same page as all the rest of us i think that would be a really good way to move forward /n","A: Hi you said you wanted to meet today, it sounded import./nT: yeah hi one i just wanted to talk to you about a group project um so i noticed that lately we've been having some kind of um unequitable shares going on in the group and i just wanted to talk to you about like what you thought your expectations are for the group project /nA: I am a senior and I am going to graduate soon, so I am really busy, so the school is not so important. /nT: What’s your dissertation on?/nA: Systems engineering. /nT:  Systems engineering oh, are you really interested in that /nA: Yeah Professor is /nT: nice so you really care about that class right and how you doing, /nA: Yes, but I am really more focused on my dissertation. /nT: right, right.

I know this course is important to you and other team members. i'm really likely to help you with the projects as i've said i have to make experience doing such projects so i think if you have any problem or a question on the project can ask me/nT: great okay thank you so what i'm hearing you say is that you are completely willing to help us work on the project and you're really busy with your dissertation but you can you want to help in any way you can and that's like that's i know that for me and my group members that's all we care about is just having you be able to be around so i think going forward with those expectations that'll be good because then we can kind of we can adjust like your schedule since we don't want you to show up to our meetings and not have you pay attention and waste your time and also our time so maybe we could think of like uh a way that you could show up to our meetings like once a week and we could have questions prepared for you so that way we're making the most of our time and being the most efficient with our time and not wasting yours /nA: Making things efficient would be helpful. Maybe you could be a leader, that would be good experience for you. /nT: yeah and if we could like we could designate like a weekly like officer or something like that so everyone could rotate and leadership positions and um like working on what we have to present that week for the project and making sure that you are on the same page as all the rest of us i think that would be a really good way to move forward /n","A: Hi how are you doing, you want to talk about something with me?/nT: yeah i'm doing all right i was just wondering if we could talk about a group project actually the group is just noticed you are a little busy with other things being a senior and we kind of had to bare a little more work so we're just wondering if we could do something about that /nA: What specifically?/nT: in specific you're late to a lot of our group meetings that we all try and show up to and make a group effort on the project we're falling behind because we don't have everyone on board on the same level and when you do show up you're often on your phone which is a little bit distracting to the rest of us i don't want to be mean but /nA: I am going to graduate soon, and I am applying for new schools, but time is really limited on my side. /nT: i understand that's perfectly understandable i get that it's very stressful being a senior and trying to apply to another school i'll get that we're just wondering if there's any way like maybe trying to be more punctual coming to the group meetings and you know when you're there just give us your full attention just so we can really knock it out when we have the time together and we can try and make make times that maybe are more adaptable to your schedule /nA: Do you have to be present every time we have group meetings?/nT: yes, that would be the best way to go about it because i mean, unless you have other stuff that's going on we understand if you have to do something else, take a test do other work priorities are priorities but as long as you can come when you do we just hope that you're not on your phone texting or anything like that just working directly with us on the group project/nA: Would you like to be the leader, and I can review things. /nT: i believe i certainly could take leadership from you if that's what you'd like to do and you can play more of a role a reviewer i think in that case it's still essential that you are present you know you're still there to be accountable for everything that goes on but that would definitely relieve you of a lot of the weight i put a little bit more on me that definitely be a nice compromise but we still we still definitely need you as a group member because you are a senior so your about your very valuable to our project /nA: Thank you for saying that. I could use skype instead of being present at every meeting. /nT: skype would definitely work if you had to skype in if you just couldn't make it in person as long as you're skyping and you hear what we're saying everyone's like president actively listening and working together that would be perfectly fine /nA: I could review everyone’s work and give suggestions. /nT: okay so you so you have done this project /nA: No, but I can give you some suggestions, because I have similar experience. /nT:i think it would be okay in the end we still definitely need you can't just be the review erbecause that's more of the role of the teacher but as long as you give us at least some input and that's a huge thing like if you're directing us you're giving us ideas if you're the idea of men and we do like work for you, that's, perfectly fine, we can take that kind of roll but we certainly need someone with the experience of a senior. We don't just need a reviewer and a suggester, we need someone to be actively participating in the project, just so it's balanced, because if it does, all wind up on me. That leaves a sophomore who's relatively in experience, in this case, just at the head of everything and thinking of everything, and i might miss something that you wouldn’t/nA: That is a fair solution, I can give you suggestion based on my experience./nT: Thank you",0,"A: What did you want to talk to me about today, is it important?/nT: yeah i just wanted to talk to you a little bit about how our group projects going because i feel like we're not where we need to be right now and i was wondering if you could have a conversation about that/nA: What do you want to discuss? /nT: myself and the other group members have known noticed that you haven't been as involved lately with the group and we were just thinking that since you are the senior and the other ones of us are a little bit more of the younger grades were wondering if we could use your expertise for the project to really help us guide and get where we need to be going /nA: I have worked hard and I have a lot of experience, but I am busy because I am applying to grad school, so I do not have much time. /nT: yeah i understand it must be really busy time for you i know graduation is coming up and that's very stressful but i think the least that we could ask right now is that the time that you do come to the projects if you could just give us your undivided attention during that time instead of maybe using your phone or something. /nA: I cannot guarantee I will be able to be in the meetings all the time, but I can communicate by phone. /nT: so you're saying that you would be available by phone if we need you for outside of the group time that we meet for, /nA: uh, yeah, i think we can. But if you cannot contact me, you can email me a list of the things you want me to do /nT: Yeah, i know it's, just like a lot of work that we're all dealing with. And we just wanted to kind of make sure, first of all, that we're all distributing the work evenly, but also that we can count on you for you to help us as the team leader in this project. /nA: I know you want to do well in the courses, but I have done quite well, so it is not that important for me to do really well. But I may not be able to take an equal amount of work. /nT: I think as long as i see where, what you're saying that you can't take the same amount of work. But this project is really important to all of us. And i know you understand that. But we would really appreciate if you, if you did, like, give it your all even if you take a smaller chunk of the work, if you could give that your attention/nA: sure, we can discuss about that.","A: Hello, how's it going? What do you want to talk to me about? It sounds important./nT: Well, it's, good to see you. I want to talk about our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that./nA: This class is really important for me to graduate. /nT:  know you're really busy with very graduation. But it'll be great to get help, accomplishing tasks. Being a senior, your expertise go would really go a long way in helping us finish this project. /nA: Yeah, i know what you are saying. I also want to do well on this project. /nT: I haven't seen you being in a while and it's hard to keep up with project, because the full team hasn't been there. /nA: I’m busy with graduation and applying for grad school. /nT: so when do you think you'll be able to be available for the meetings? At what point in time?/nA: You can appoint some time. If I am available at that time I will participate. /nT: do you think it be possible for you to do your portion of the essay beforehand and then not attend the meetings we could build up what you already have/nA:  yeah sure i will appreciate yeah/nT:  because as you know like a lot of our the paper has been written by the same kind of voice so if you being a senior have more expertise would start the essay we could build up what you have in trying to write in the same voice /nA: yeah sure but uh as far as i have as i don't have so much time so what i would appreciate it if you don't assign too much work for me/nT: okay that that's the case would be possible to ask the professor for extension? you asked a lot of questions in class are very attentive so i think you'd be very receptive to you asking for extension specifically /nA: I have nearly fulfilled the requirements for graduation, but perfection is not my goal. /nT: it would really help developing us since we're only sophomores, we don't really know too much about the class. You have to excel well since you’re applying for graduate schools, your very bright future ahead of you, you have experience and the expertise, so you putting in some work, it kind of guiding us really help was a long run, trying to get us to where you are today. /nA: Yeah, I can help. I can give direction, but I may not be able to do a large amount of practical work. /nT: Well, there's, a three-thousand-word paper and there's four of us total, so How many words do you think you'd be able to do? /nA: Five hundred, /nT: five hundred? Wouldn’t about eight hundred about right, it’s only three hundred more words, it’s like half a page maybe/nA: In that case, I may not guarantee the quality of my parts. /nT: Why is that?/nA: In order to do good work, I have to work for a long time on it. With less work, I can focus more on making it higher quality./nT: could you do the five hundred words, and then you ask for an extension and finish the rest of the work afterwards, after you know, applying to schools ? /nA: Yeah, sure, yeah. /nT: Okay, great. So sounds like a compromise. /nA: Yeah, sounds good, thank you","A: hello come in. Why do you want to talk with me today ? Is that anything important ?/nT: Oh, yeah, um, it's, good to see you, too. I want to talk to you about our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be and i want to discuss with you how we could improve that. /nA: Sure, I’m open to any feedback/nT: I feel like i know i understand that you've been very busy getting ready for graduation um but it would be great if you could help us pull more weight with the final project especially being a senior, I think you would have a lot of insight that you could offer us/nA:  yeah, actually I have worked hard for the classes for years to get a relatively high i have i think my expertise help us to make this project better and uh that’s why I am also assigned to be the leader of the project but as you know that i'm going to graduate and i am applying to different graduate programs in different cities so i make i may be frequent out of town so i can't make sure that's how much time i can devote into this project /nT: uh well i feel like if you were assigned senior leader than that gives you a lot of responsibility that you still have to uphold even though you're about to graduate but it's the final stretch and it's not really fair to the other people that are in the group if you don't pull your weight as well so if you could just continue coming to meetings and responding to everybody else's messages about it just so that way we could get it done to the best of our ability and we really need someone to coordinate it all so i understand you have a lot to do but and it's just if the final stretch so you have to help us put in the last of work for it. /nA: Yeah, i like to help, and we can have become some meetings to discuss about it, and i can assign each member of our team’s work, since I am not usually at as the university. So i'm afraid i can not be present at every meeting of our team. So maybe we can try to try other ways of Communicating with each other within the group. For example, maybe I can create some google docs online, and again, we can make some modification. And if you guys want to have some meeting. You can meet first, and then report your conclusion to me If i have time I will try to view it /nT: Um, yeah, well, um, yeah, if you, like, went through, made like, an itinerary, something like that just so that we're on the same page. Or just emails to coordinate it, that would be good, Um, but just as much time as you can give for it. For, like before the project’s submitted or something like that. It's, like we would definitely to have a meeting before then. So. But as long as we're all on the same page with the information that we need. /nA: And that's let's discuss about the details, we are required to submit a three thousand word paper and maybe for the five members of our group i can see that if we set it equal each one will that the responsibility to write about six hundred words and but since i have limited time what about i just take five hundred and the rest of you take the rest of the two thousand five hundred words /nT: no if we're gonna divide it equally, we should divided equally between everyone i mean everyone it's like final season everyone has a lot of work going for them it's just like a matter of budgeting each of our time and i'm sorry that it’s difficult um but it's just not really fair to everybody else to put more on their plate but we can still like email back and forth like that or meet as a group if you need help writing it but it just wouldn't be fair if other people take more words to write/nA:  yeah I also understand that i can do this it's equal part of the work but since i cannot devote so much time having that if i if i also do that the six hundred words work  I may not  guarantee the quality of my part of work /nT: well as long as you do the six hundred words, it's like all of everyone divided up equally then we can go through and help you edit it and we can all work on editing everyone’s parts together. So /nA: so you mean everyone of my team can help me to edit my version of work, to get, get a better overall score right? /nT: Yeah, yeah, so long as everyone is doing to the same amount of work. You help each other edit it /nA: Yeah. Oh, he's. Sure, it makes sense. We can meet with each group is a group member tomorrow for lunch together for a discussion about that. /nT: Ok sounds good/nA: Thank you.",0,"A: hi how's it going. /nT: I'm doing well, it's, good to see you, /nA: uh, what do you want to talk about today. /nT: I want to talk about a group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be. I want to discuss with you how we can improve that. /nA: Okay, uh, what's problem. /nT: The group and i just feel that we have a lot to shoulder and we were hoping that you'd be able to take on some more work /nA: Um, ok here's a situation, I’m a fourth year student and really busy recently and i even need to apply for new graduate schools so i don't have enough time /nT: no right yeah some of us noticed that you've been pretty busy but we just wanted you to have a chance to be able to work on the project because we think you would have some good insight and it would be beneficial for all of us /nA: yeah i would like to but i don't have time to meet you every week or every time we meet. Do you have another solution?/nT: i mean well so you're saying you don't have time to meet right, but coming into this class you knew that there would be some sort of outside meeting requirements right and so that was described to you even before taking on this project which we all agreed to and from our understanding you are the senior of the group you are most respected individual in our group by the professor and so with that if anything the professor would be disappointed with not seeing your contributions if that makes sense /nA: yeah i understand that the score or something about assessment are very important to you but from my standing point, the score are not so important because i'm going to graduate but i would like to help you if you need any assistance and by the way i think if you can be the leader ofthe group project and will be a very good experience for you /nT: i agree completely but the roles have been designated already and so it would be insulting almost to the professor if we were to try to switch roles at this point considering the project is due so soon but i do understand that you are graduating you have a lot going on and so not meeting all the time is understandable but meeting the task that we all have to do is important so that we are able to finish the project in a respective manner because for my understanding if we don't finish this project well enough you won't actually be able to graduate /nA: yeah of course but uh maybe a higher score or a lower score that kind of gap is not so important what about this, we don't need to necessary change the conceptual role of the leader or something, maybe you can just do more work and i can review your work do you think that will work /nT: well considering that i've been putting in a lot more work along with my other, two group members and like the fact that the work that like we've been having a pick up your work it's not acceptable at this point and considering that we've already covered for you and we're still asking to let's just review the work isn't really acceptable so i would really appreciate if you could understand and try to meet us halfway and start picking up the slack from this point onwards /nA: so you mean that we cannot switching roles or like doing things another ways like I doing the review work you doing there like basic works do you think they're all not work which means i have to do like equally with you guys /nT: yeah i think i think would be best if we all put in equal work right because it's not that i'm as as the leader is not that because your leader you have to do more work for because i'm not leader i don't have to do more work it's we both have to put in equal work if anything you being leader you should be leading the way in terms of how much work we put in and how what expectations we should meet but like with the way we're going we're not even gonna be able to present in a well formatted way due to our you know, miscommunications and like are inattentiveness during the meetings you know /nA: yeah but what what we are doing now not reach a solution because you know i'm busy you're still asking me to squeeze my time to like dedicate more time on this project rather than just save my time to do it in an efficient way so i don't think this is applicable because i still don't have enough time. The time is a critical factor in this situation. /nT: I see your point. So do do you have any suggestions as to what we can do ? Because at this point, we're not where we need to be on the project, and the other team members and myself are trying as hard as we can, but we won't be able to make it without your contributions. /nA: Yeah, i think this scenarios might experience really is important. I suggest that we can, i can, do they review of your work. If you can write something, write a proposal, paper, or something, I can review it give some suggestion, and you can edit it later. You think that will work? /nT: Um not quite because this is a three thousand page three thousand word paper right and so it's actually very feasible if we do split it up by sections within the four people and so it would be best if you could try to contribute even like just put down your ideas you know because if it's a it's a factor of quality over quantity at this point and so if you can't, if you don't have much time then at least get your thoughts down and then we could flesh out the ideas and then if that's what you're talking about then and you can review it and see if that's what you wanted to include in that section /nA: yeah i think that what i'm trying to say like just sharing my idea and review later and maybe save time is critical for me, that’s what I’m saying/nT: well yeah but by sharing ideas you need to be present in the meetings and like actually contribute so if you can if you can show us that you are willing to contribute and willing to put down something that will help us get what you want into the project because you are the senior right you are the project leader so you know what's going on you have this position for a reason and so with that i think it would be best if you did try to add your insights into the project /nA: yeah i think that will work /n","A: Hello, how’s it going?/nT: um, it's, good. Uh, i'm doing well, i just, uh, i wanted to talk to you about our group project. I don't think we’re at where we want to be, and maybe we can talk about how to fix that. /nA: What would you like me to do?/nT: Um, yeah, it just feels like the group and i have a lot to do, and it would really help out. A lot of you contributed some work, too. /nA: I am kind of busy, so I can’t take anymore writing jobs, so I hope you can understand. /nT: Yeah, we've, uh, we've noticed that you have been pretty busy and that you haven’t been able to do some of the writing. I think we really need some help and that you would be able to help us out a lot since you’re a senior and probably know more about this than we do./nA: Maybe I can share notes with you? We could also create a schedule./nT: Uh, yeah, i think, uh, you're inside notes would help a lot. Way should stay, keep communication, but, like, so far, you've been missing some of the meetings So i just want to make sure you come to that So we're all on the same page. /nA: I haven’t been able to show up, the last few weeks, if I can’t show up an I work on it on Google Docs/nT: That would help us a lot. /nA: Great. ","A: hi how's it going. /nT: I'm doing well, it's, good to see you, /nA: uh, what do you want to talk about today. /nT: I want to talk about a group project.

I’m working with my professor now on my thesis defense. I feel so bad I didn’t put so much effort in on the project./nT: Yeah, and some of us noticed that you haven't. Pretty busy. But we just wanted you to have a chance to be a little work on the project. We think you have great insight on a lot of the stuff we're doing. /nA: Yeah, so what kind of input do you want to give me to disperse? We should have, like some rules before finals, literally, I’m not the time going to type out the words, so what kind of input/nT:  So, honestly, at first i was really excited when the professor placed you with us because i've noticed you have asked really great insightful questions in class and you are really attentive. But then i know it's it's, like you're almost completely different student with the group projects and, uh, it's, really frustrating, because i know that you have a lot of input in knowledge about the subject, and as a sophomore i'd really like to gain and learn something, but not only that, but you are the leader of this project's. So because we have to submit this project, you are kind of the person by the syllabus and by the description of the assignment who was supposed to oversee this. So i guess you know, me and the rest of the group, we've talked and, uh, we're really excited and want to work on this project, but we can't get it unless if we get some direction from you. /nA:  I can share my notes in class and I can propose on guidelines for this project. Maybe we  schedule like a meeting in coming weeks. So I can share with you guys my stuff on this project. /nT: yeah, definitely just like a way to collaborate, that's. Really great. To be able to kind of more equally distribute so that all of us would end up working less because it's, equally distributed. I agree with you, yeah./nA: So you know, I can meet with you guys, and we can meet like once a week and we can write down what’s the next steps and we can separate online./nT: Yeah, that works better for your schedule then. /nA: My hands are so tied./nT: Well, that, yeah, definitely. Like, i think, if the group meetings meeting up so often in person is a problem that i'd definitely be fine with limiting the in person meetings and having you do work online if that that works better for your schedule. /nA: Yeah, yeah, I appreciate that. So great. So i can maybe you can just directly assign me the tasks you want, /nT: yeah, that works for you, that, yeah, we could definitely do that. Yeah, I appreciate you saying what your issues are because then, you know, all of us want to do well on the project, you know, that's, the end goal, so whatever it takes, it takes to get there, like, you know, we're all doing everything. /nA: Cool, I work closely with out advisor, so I can negotiate some better communication with him between the crew members and our advisors./nT: Perfect/nA: That’s what a leader should do/nT: I agree","A: Hello how are you?/nT: Good how’s it going?/nA:  good it's good yeah so what do you want to talk with me /nT: uh yes so i just wanted to uh talk to you a bit about the way that the project is going just to see kind of where you /nA: ok sure what is the problem?/nT:  i think recently i've just been have been nervous about how much work we still have left to do before the end of the project and i just kind of wanted to talk to you see about how you felt /nA: okay so i think we have a lot of things to do but uh you know i'm a senior student and probably don't have enough time i'm doing the project so probably i won't have you know i can't go through everyday detail with you and you know i'm the leader of the project probably just i could give you somebody ideas. do you agree with me do you think /nT: uh well i know that i certainly appreciate your guidance on the input that you have but i do feel like some points that the work balance is a bit uneven /nA: i think so but you know, this is difference between because i'm the leader of the project so probably there difference between them after the project with you what we what's your effort down project i think there's a difference between that so probably i won't spend a lot of time on that /nT: so you see the role as being more like a delegator for someone who kind of directs the project but isn't involved in it unnecessarily /nA: yes i probably can be involving project you know is due on my project i just say that i probably don't have too much time with that won't spend a lot of time if you can understand me/nT: yeah i think i definitely do but i think i in some ways i feel a bit like i've got a lot of work and sometimes i feel like i might not be able to accomplish it all just by myself um and i really value your experience and your knowledge is a senior and so i think i was just looking for maybe some more direct help on the project /nA: yeah I can provide some direct help on that i think probably i want to be sure i will be present or show up on the meeting or something maybe I can contact you some other way  but i can definitely give you some help on the project /nT: okay, well i think i think that that works i mean if you have a busier schedule or you just need to you know, spend your time doing doing other things the times with we have the meetings, but i think we would definitely appreciate it your contributions obviously because you know you're such an integral part of the the project. /nA: Yes, i think you're much about that so probably just like you said probably I won’t put some too much effort out there. I can give you some help. So, uh, we'll talk about the like, the meeting or how can we contact ? /nT: Yeah,  So what, um, what methods of communication are best for you ? /nA: I think probably through email, you know? /nT: Okay, yeah, yeah, email works. Um, i know, i think probably some of the other group members will want to still be meeting in person. And so you're i think in that situation you'd be free to come and join us. But if that's not, you know, if those times on available in your schedule, then we could potentially still communicate through email. /nA: Yeah, i think if you want to, like, have a face to face meeting, uh, probably we can talk through from skype. What do you think ? /nT: Yeah, yeah, that works. Um, yeah. Um, and in in terms of, uh, deciding what, What sort of times were available, Do you have a schedule or something ? /nA: I can probably send you an email and let you know when I have time. /nT: Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. So email you'll send me to schedule. /nA: Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Okay.","A: How are you/nT: pretty good about yourself?/nA: I’m pretty busy, I'm graduating this summer, so as you can tell. Thesis defense something like that./nT:  I just wanted to bing up our group project. So we've been having some issues recently, and you feel like you haven't been participating as fully as you could. And as a group, we're relying on, you, provide guidance and help us get through this. Some of us have felt that we're picking up the slack on your part, and we were just wondering whether there is any way you could add more to this project with this project. /nA: So could you please tell what is it that I could contribute to this project? What do you guys expect me to get some input? /nT: okay, so, for example, to some or our meanings, you have showed up late, and you don’t really add any value to these meetings. We see in class that you're paying attention and take diligent notes if you could bring those notes to our meetings./nA: so i should summarize them and share them with you guys. Maybe as a deadline to our meetings so our project we should present a report. I should be honest with you i literally don't have the time to finish all the details of the Report. So how about you guys like assign like a portion of the work?/nT: So that that is one approach. However, you've been assigned to the team leader, group leader. So and as a senior who has had experience in other classes with this. You’re the one who's close to professor and we're kind of relying on you to you to help push us through this. And if you say you don't have time, would it be possible to talk to the professor and potentially come up with a solution there. So where you're providing more help to this project? /nA: So you guys see me as a link between the group and the professor?  I understand that, so maybe i can be responsible for the communication between the group and the professor so maybe I can update to the professor our weekly meetings, and i can do that, but i don't really want to spend too much time on this report i can Like putting my insights with you guys. And I share my reviews and my understanding of the project, Maybe we can just meet  once, every two weeks, two weeks, or maybe just cancel the weekly meetings. I literally don’t have so much time every week with you guys. I can take, a portion of the work with you guys I can share with you guys all the time.  I don't want to spend so much time. I can share with you the coding skill, something like that research, ever be with you guys ? I really hope you are the major members working on this project because I’m graduating this summer, i only got i really don't need an a or and a minus. To pass this course just a medium level, I will be satisfied with this kind of result./nT:  Okay, however, the rest of us are not graduating, and we want to put in the effort team to get this a because it’s Still, it still matters for us. /nA: Okay. I can promise I can show up in our group meeting. And just assign me like light weight. I have a schedule. Whatever summary, just some guidelines I don't want to touch it on the bottom work, like the coding and literature review. Can you guys do that? /nT: Right. Yeah, you might have to do more than that, because so far, we’ve been picking up so much slack and it's tough for us, the sophomores have a little less experience. We can assign you work, and if you can't meet every week, we can, have you do a summary online with both your notes and your work. So i think that might a possible solution. But if we do assign you work. We appreciate you either complete it, or if find it to be too much and unfair. If you could communicate that to us, as soon as possible so we can adjust./nA:  Here’s what i'm going to do, I ‘m  going to put a little effort into this project with you guys. And so you understand. I'm the guy, going to next chapter in my life, and you guys are already expecting good results in this course. I did do my best in trying to catch up with you guys and to present my insights and I’m going to talk to my professor. Try to get engaged in this group. /nT: That works.","A: hello how is going what do you want to talk with me today? is that anything important?/nT:  hi i'm doing well it's good to see you and i just wanted to talk to you about our group project /nA: okay I guess we can discuss it what’s something special?/nT: um i feel like we're not where we need to be exactly with our project i just wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that /nA: okay sure /nT: um so i know you're probably really busy with preparing for graduation but it would be great if you could complete some of the tasks being a senior your expertise would go a really long way in helping us finish the project /nA: yeah actually that says that i find busy i'm going to graduate and i have maybe many job interviews in different cities so I will be frequently out of town. i might i not have so many so much time to devote to our project. As the leader  of the project it's also my responsibility to help all of us to do well in our project and uh so uh so what's the requirement for me?/nT: right i think it would be a good idea that maybe we could sit down and look at your schedule and just figure out when we could accomplish our task that we need to finish um we could work around your schedule. I understand that you're very busy, but it would be great if you could help us out. /nA: Okay. Sure, my expertise can surely help, let me to help to guide you, to do the project, and but, no, i think how about this? Maybe, but i cannot guarantee that i will do the most part of the work. maybe we kept divide it's equally and I will do relatively less work and the rest of you can do more work. And, after all, i after all I will try to combine all of them together, for example, we have. We have to write reports about three thousand words How about I would be responsible for four or five hundred words in this and the rest off your four members takes a take the rest off, maybe two thousand five hundred. /nT: This is for the three thousand paper word paper that we're working on right now? um could you repeat what you were saying to divide it up? /nA: Okay, we have five members and maybe if we divide it equally maybe each one will take six hundred right and that's for me i can not takes so much and maybe i can just guarantee my work of four hundred or five hundred and you may take more maybe to two hundred two hundred or more in this and after all i will be responsible to combine all of us work together /nT: right yeah, i don't think that it's completely necessary that we all write equal parts but as long as you do make up that work in contributing after the work after the everything is written you could maybe help edit it and combine it like you were saying so i feel i feel like that would be a good compromise here. /nA: Okay sure thanks for understanding and but and maybe but i mean that we may not get the chances to to meet all of our members being our group so maybe for some times i can edit the reports online that once i get time i'm not able to response to your requests quickly. /nT: Okay, yeah, we can make sure to give you enough time to respond. We know that we can really expect immediate responses but i feel like if we were to plan out your schedule and work with your schedule, that would make things easier for everyone. /nA: Okay. Thanks for your understanding. So, uh, maybe. We will, we can discuss with all of the members tomorrow, to make a sure and send our assigned work for us/nT:  Sure, do you want to meet you said you want to meet tomorrow ? Is there a time that works for you ? /nA: Maybe tomorrow, lunch time, we can discuss and have lunch together?/nT: Sure.","A: Hello how’s it going, what do you want to talk, talk to me about? /nT: Oh, yeah, i was just wondering. I want to talk to you about the project that we're doing. You know, i know you probably are pretty busy with stuff with graduation and planning jobs up for, uh, you know, after you're done with school here, obviously that's, super important, but we still just kind of need to get through this project, and i was wondering if you could maybe work on some things because we still have some, you know, some gaps to fill in before he turned it. And we think as a group, we think, you know, you know a lot about class, you're always talking, you know what you're talking about. So i was wondering if, you know, if you could help us out there, /nA: Sure, I can help you, what would you like me to do?/nT: So it's, four of us. And we've got three thousand word paper let's. See, how many pages is that? /nA: Four, four, five pages/nT: if you could. Just write one of the body paragraphs. That would help a lot. /nA: I can write one main paragraph as the leader. I can do four hundred words./nT:  Well, so if you just want to do like, four hundred words, do you think you could help, like with the editing process then, we kind of want to split it up evenly like you know you're the leader. But, i mean, the leader just has to kind of like help out, editing and stuff, and make sure we've got all our now fruits in a basket and everything. So, do you think you could help us, like editing and stuff, especially since you've been going to college longer? you've written more papers than all of us, so i think you i have some pretty good expertise on that. /nA: I can do the work once we have finished writing all the words. I cannot guarantee how much time I can devoted. I cannot guarantee the quality of my work./nT: Maybe you could write six hundred words, and i can help with the editing. or you could write like four hundred words for, like, four hundred words. And then, since the professor seems to like you, you could bring our paper to professor and, ask for the professor's, you know, comments, and then he can help us edit it. And then you could just bring it back to us. And we can make those suggested changes /nA: Submit it to the professor and have him edit it?/nT: Well submit it to the professor so the professor can edit it. /nA: I’m not sure if the professor would like to edit it. /nT: You don't think so? Well, i was thinking i mean, i'm not super close with the professor, but, you know, most the professors that i have worked here, you know, i can bring in my paper even like the outline and ask for their suggestions. So i think if we did that, you can you can just, like, go and ask him if that's the case. But, i mean, the bottom line is i think, you know, the most fruitful way of doing this is if you asked him because the professor seems to like you. /nA: I can do that. /nT: So if you wrote like the main paragraph in all of us also added either like a main paragraph or the conclusion introductions so you can write like the first body for something and then you can have i can write a body paragraph and the rest can figure out a conclusion introduction and other body paragraphs. And then once we've already done that, we can get it all together. You can bring it to the professor, and ask if the professor would like to edit it and then you can bring it back to us and we can all edit it together /nA: sure, no problem, /nT: cool, thanks.","Just go and start. /nA: Hi/nT: Hi/nA: What’s up?/nT: I, uh, not doing too well actually, we are behind on our group project and I think you’re the cause of it. /nA: Could you please explain in a little more detail What specifically ?/nT:  Yeah, the group and i just feel that we have had a lot of shoulder, and you're hoping to be able to take on more work. /nA:  To be honest with you, I’ve been quite busy these days because I’m graduating this summer. I’m working with my professor now on my thesis defense. I feel so bad I didn’t put so much effort in on the project./nT: Yeah, and some of us noticed that you haven't. Pretty busy. But we just wanted you to have a chance to be a little work on the project. We think you have great insight on a lot of the stuff we're doing. /nA: Yeah, so what kind of input do you want to give me to disperse? We should have, like some rules before finals, literally, I’m not the time going to type out the words, so what kind of input/nT:  So, honestly, at first i was really excited when the professor placed you with us because i've noticed you have asked really great insightful questions in class and you are really attentive. But then i know it's it's, like you're almost completely different student with the group projects and, uh, it's, really frustrating, because i know that you have a lot of input in knowledge about the subject, and as a sophomore i'd really like to gain and learn something, but not only that, but you are the leader of this project's. So because we have to submit this project, you are kind of the person by the syllabus and by the description of the assignment who was supposed to oversee this. So i guess you know, me and the rest of the group, we've talked and, uh, we're really excited and want to work on this project, but we can't get it unless if we get some direction from you. /nA:  I can share my notes in class and I can propose on guidelines for this project. Maybe we  schedule like a meeting in coming weeks. So I can share with you guys my stuff on this project. /nT: yeah, definitely just like a way to collaborate, that's. Really great. To be able to kind of more equally distribute so that all of us would end up working less because it's, equally distributed. I agree with you, yeah./nA: So you know, I can meet with you guys, and we can meet like once a week and we can write down what’s the next steps and we can separate online./nT: Yeah, that works better for your schedule then. /nA: My hands are so tied./nT: Well, that, yeah, definitely. Like, i think, if the group meetings meeting up so often in person is a problem that i'd definitely be fine with limiting the in person meetings and having you do work online if that that works better for your schedule. /nA: Yeah, yeah, I appreciate that. So great. So i can maybe you can just directly assign me the tasks you want, /nT: yeah, that works for you, that, yeah, we could definitely do that. Yeah, I appreciate you saying what your issues are because then, you know, all of us want to do well on the project, you know, that's, the end goal, so whatever it takes, it takes to get there, like, you know, we're all doing everything. /nA: Cool, I work closely with out advisor, so I can negotiate some better communication with him between the crew members and our advisors./nT: Perfect/nA: That’s what a leader should do/nT: I agree","A: Hi/nT: Hi/nA: How are you?/nT: I’m doing well, how about yourself ? /nA: I’m pretty busy. /nT: Yeah, no, i mean, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. The reason that i actually want to meet with you. I was just about this project. I i noticed that, I think that there's a little bit of miscommunication between what we both expected each other as far as the project goes. /nA: Could you please explain. /nT:  Yeah, yeah. So i think that just you obviously were assigned group team leader, and i think that as that just i think that with some of the other members, just kind of being on your phone and just kind of acting, you know, a little withdrawn from the situation. I think that that's kind of set the example, and i think that's kind of the direction it's going. And, i mean, it makes total sense. You're busy, you know, you have a lot to look forward to in your future, and i mean, it makes sense. But i just think that when we're there, if we just decide to be there, i think that we could really rally/nA: So I should put more effort into the project?/nT: I'm just saying that when we're there, we were just there, and we just are able to kind of divvy up the work and kind of come to what we expect from each other. I think that it would make it a lot more clear.  And I think that just one thing that i expect, just with any group that i work with, is that when people are their they're actually their they're actually playing attention/nA: I haven’t been able to meet with you guys in the last few weeks. Maybe you could assign me some tasks. I don’t think I can type all the words, but I can share notes and propose guidelines. /nT: Yeah, no, i get what you're saying about not wanting to type just because, you know, obviously, group member, you have a lot to oversee. And so i think that if we just, they kind of divvy that up. Because if you're giving us your guidelines in your notes, then you know it just is semantics putting it on paper. /nA: I prefer to work on my own. I want less meetings. /nT: i get what you're saying. So you're saying, you know, group meetings, just assign it out. Then we'll just come together at the end, you know, last minute check, read over it. /nA: I can be the link between the group and the advisor. /nT: that would be big time, just kind of understanding what he expects from a group project. That's, really, you know, definitely valuable. And i think that just the only doing issue that I had. I just wasn't sure if your level of engagement was kind of turning the group into this. But i mean, it makes sense. If you say you're fine, just an off line type of guy. /nA: I can just show up and show my progress./nT: yeah, no, i think that that would be awesome. I’d say were on the same page as far as that goes?","A: Hello how’s it going, what do you want to talk, talk to me about? /nT: Oh, yeah, i was just wondering. I want to talk to you about the project that we're doing.

Um, and in in terms of, uh, deciding what, What sort of times were available, Do you have a schedule or something ? /nA: I can probably send you an email and let you know when I have time. /nT: Yeah.

I feel like we were not able to meet the needs that wanted to just one discussed to you about how we can do better. /nA: I’m the senior student and I am graduating this summer, so I am pretty busy, what would you like to do?/nT: Yeah, i mean, obviously, like you said, i know you're really busy preparing for graduation and everything, but i think it would be great if you could help accomplish at least some of the tasks. being a senior, I know, like your expertise after studying for four years, would be really helpful and would go a really long way to helping us finish his project. /nA: I can give you some insight, can we schedule a weekly meeting. /nT: Yeah, definitely, the only thing I noticed is that because you are always so busy. Uh, you never tend to respond whatever we hold meetings, and because of those reasons it’s been kind of hard to just keep up with everything. So it would be better if you could make sure that everyone can attend/nA: If you assign me several tasks and give me a deadline, I can do them. I cannot show up for every meeting. /nT: Yeah I think we could definitely give you some tasks that you can finish, but I also think its important to me at some point, so that the team could get a holistic view, because, obviously we can learn from whatever you have to say as well. But we can definitely give you things how you think we can make sure that you actually do finish whatever we assigned you to?/nA: You can set deadlines and I can send you my work. You can maybe meet without me./nT: Like you said, you are graduating and this class also important, obviously, to graduating, so it would also help if you could just show some more support, as we're going through it as well. /nA: I can contribute as much as I can but you may have to help me a little bit more on this project. You guys are productive, so you can help me. /nT: I think the biggest thing is that since it is us four working on it,  It makes more sense that all four divvy up all the work, twenty five per cent each, especially because again it’s a group party, that we should be working on together regardless of how much older or where the group leader is. If we are the ones assigned to do the work, all four of us should be working together. So of course, we can give you a fourth of it to do. We can give to you online so we can work on it in google docs or something, and you have to meet every single time. It is important that you do at least a fourth of the work, and then i'll finish it off by the deadlines we assign. /nA: I can show my progress, maybe you guys could not push me so hard on the meetings. /nT: Because obviously you won’t be able to show up to every meeting, I think it’s also most important, that the meetings that you to show up to that to also act in a very productive manner, like not being on your phone or not on social media the entire time. Rather if we are meeting for two hours. Let's, just crank that for those two hours, and then you obviously don't have to stay for longer than that, but just so that we can get, you get the work done and just not have to worry about it.","A: Hello, how is it going, why do you want to talk with me today? /nT: Uh, i was just wondering, um, if you've had a chance to work on the project it on your assigned part. /nA: Yeah, i also want to, well in the project. /nT: Yeah, so did you do your part, yet? Remember, we liked three divided parts if we thought we'd best and we gave you, a certain part, because we thought that you like being a senior with all this experience. We thought that, you'd be able to do this part really well. /nA: I haven’t finished yet because i was just out, town and i just returned yesterday. I am busy today. /nT: Maybe we can work on it this weekend. And then by then, we'll all have a part's done, actually, just practice at that point. /nA: So you think you have you finished all your parts /nT: yeah we've all finished our parts we're just waiting on yours too kind of complete it /nA: I am busy because I am graduating and I am applying to different graduate programs. I cannot guarantee how much time I can commit. /nT: oh do you need a split your project amongst us for your part amongst all of us you /nA: Yeah /nT: just maybe let's meet up and then see like what part you feel comfortable doing and then see what we feel comfortable doing /nA: Could you do 300 words of my 1000 word part?/nT: let me talk to the rest of the group and see what everyone else can do see how they're doing their parts and then yeah but probably we can split it up in them try to finish it soon /nA: When are we going to meet?/nT: as soon as possible whenever it's good for you then we can figure it out decide then, /nA: I may leave tomorrow, I will not be able to present at the meeting. /nT: even if we could meet up for just thirty minutes,/nA: Could we meet online. /nT:   maybe tonight, after you're done prepping for your interview and feel a little less tired Maybe we could meet up, on facebook or something, and then figure it out then/nA: Thank you/nT: Cool, no problem. ","A: Hello, how’s it going?/nT: um, it's, good. Uh, i'm doing well, i just, uh, i wanted to talk to you about our group project. I don't think we’re at where we want to be, and maybe we can talk about how to fix that. /nA: What would you like me to do?/nT: Um, yeah, it just feels like the group and i have a lot to do, and it would really help out. A lot of you contributed some work, too. /nA: I am kind of busy, so I can’t take anymore writing jobs, so I hope you can understand. /nT: Yeah, we've, uh, we've noticed that you have been pretty busy and that you haven’t been able to do some of the writing. I think we really need some help and that you would be able to help us out a lot since you’re a senior and probably know more about this than we do./nA: Maybe I can share notes with you? We could also create a schedule./nT: Uh, yeah, i think, uh, you're inside notes would help a lot. Way should stay, keep communication, but, like, so far, you've been missing some of the meetings So i just want to make sure you come to that So we're all on the same page. /nA: I haven’t been able to show up, the last few weeks, if I can’t show up an I work on it on Google Docs/nT: That would help us a lot. /nA: Great. ","A: Hello, how are you?/nT: I'm doing well, it is good to see you. I wanted to talk about her project. I feel like we're not where we need to be and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that. /nA: Sounds important. So what in particular?/nT: i know you're probably really busy with preparing for graduation, but it would be great if you could accomplish some task being a senior, your expertise would really go a long way in helping us finish this project /nA: So what do you want me to do? /nT: I i haven't seen you at meetings in a while and it's been hard keep hard to keep up with the project because the full team hasn't been there. /nA: Okay, so, you know, and am going to graduate from school, so i think it's probably hard for me to join every meeting. Can we discuss the project in another way?/nT: It's not that it's like you haven't been but only you only missed a few you've missed a large amount of our meetings i like you like even though you might be graduating we are not like as team leader you took the responsibility of leading us and helping us and guiding us and like you haven't really been doing that like i'm sorry if that sounds rude, it’s just like this like our grades are still dependent on this project and like we're not all graduating so like if like your input is really affecting our grade /nA: I still need the credit of this course and of course but um as you know i probably don't have too much time to put our put it i can’t promise that I can put in that much time on the project. /nT: even if you can't like show for each meeting like please at least let us know so that we could like least like let you know what you can do because like i guess like there has been like a lot of miscommunication here and like um you aren’t like notifying us when you don't come i'm like way we just really appreciate it and like for at least there'd be like a legitimate excuse like i know senioritis is like a very big thing but like as well like as i said like our grade is still dependent on this like at our gpa is like still very dependent on this /nA: You know that I am the leader, and I can be in contact with the professor, so I can give you some ideas on the project, but I cannot go through every detail of the project. /nT: I think as a member of this team is like all equal responsibility it shouldn't be more or less i think because it's like you decided to join this group and you burdened the responsibility and like we all have that same responsibility all of us are busy with clubs extracurriculars, other classes like i don't think anyone is too busy for this one class and so i think even if you got, like, one hour like less one hour off like less sleep in the night like you should be pulling equal weight as the rest of us /nA: I understand, I can do my part, but you could contact me another way. /nT: i think, yeah, like honestly, like maybe meeting meeting in person is always necessary. It might be necessary near, the end of the project, but like if there is, like, a constant, like flow of communication and like we are miss communicating, we like delegated tasks like relatively quickly, like i honestly don't think it will be that much work or like that much of a burden. So, like, i think, as long as we're still texting, communicating somehow, then we will be good. /nA: I can give you my schedule and we can work around that. /nT:  uh, yeah, most definitely, I think like communication is the key for us to like, getting a good grade on this project. /nA: Yeah, yeah","A: Hi, why do you want to meet me today?/nT: No  ma'am, i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potential increasing my salary/nA: Okay, let’s discuss this, but you need to justify why you deserve an increase in salary./nT:  I've done a lot of good things for the company. I have led many projects, borrowed. A lot of business for the company, have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: I cannot just give you a raise because you have done a lot of work. Why do you want a raise?/nT: You can ask anyone in the office including upper management about my work and i work harder than almost anyone /nA: Okay, working hard is one thing, but getting a raise in salary is another thing. Why do you deserve a raise at this time?/nT: because i've been working here for up to for three years and i feel like i've done a lot of work and that of my like a raise is now justified because i've been working here for three years and for all the work that i put in that i deserved i deserve a higher salary because of all the work that i've done these past three years /nA: It is complicated process to raise your salary, and I am not the person who makes the final decision. /nT: yeah, i just wanted to like bring this up to you so that you could see like like to see you like my portfolio work that i've done in these past three years so that you could probably because you probably have connections to the upper level management you could probably ask them like that this employee has been working this well for the past three years that maybe he could get a raise or could you increase the salary because i know you like you said you're not you know what the final decision for getting a raise but i feel that you have those other connections that will help me get that raise or give me like a good reference of referral to get a raise/nA:  yes indeed uh but uh i have to remind you that uh everyone everyone works really hard in your in your company and we really enjoying working with you but raising salary can be a long process. It may take a while./nT: that's fine but i just want teo bring it up so that maybe like if it doesn't happen now but like down the line that hopefully it's like processed or like goes through i just wanted to bring this up to just to show like all the work that i have put in and that in a couple of months or like even in like the next year that i have a higher salary than i am working right now. /nA: You mean you can’t wait for the decision? You want to go to another company ? /nT: No, i've really enjoyed working at this company, and i feel like you've seen my working these last three years. So i trust you that, like you've seen my work ethic and, like, like my, uh, work portfolio, that i'll stay here and i'll eventually get this salary raise. /nA: You can wait and I can start in the process?/nT: Yeah, that sounds great. I just wanted to bring it up to you so that, like, i don't have to come back here like in a couple of months and bring up this same question back to you, to, ask you to raise my salary because we've already talked about it right now. So in a couple of months, i should be like seeing like other steps. /nA: i think that will work","A: Hi, so what brings you to my office?/nT: Hi sir, thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I know you must be busy, and i'm hoping, if you have the time, if we could talk about potentially of me getting a raise./nA: Why do you need a raise?/nT: I've been working here now for the past three years, very consistently, bringing in a lot of business, and last year I earned the highest productivity in the office. I was also employee of the month, and I think, on top of that, also taking on more work load than i've been assigned kind of proves that i deserve a raise /nA: So you are not satisfied with your current salary, what increase are you looking for?/nT: Yes, sir. I think, based on the amount, uh, level of my workload, i think fifteen percent raise would be ideal. /nA: Are you comparing different offers from other companies?/nT: i've done that and also just looking within the company, especially because i've taken a higher level. Like, filled in for higher level positions. And i think i'm capable of moving forward and upward in the company. /nA: Right now you are interested in moving to another company?/nT: No, i'm interested in moving upwards in our company. /nA: We have a standard procedure for applying for a raise in our company, do you do this?/nT: I transferred from my office in the us to this office. I think the process may have been a little bit different, but i think just the workload that i take while i've been here, it doesn't quite match the salary that i'm receiving now/nA: Just apply in the system and just wait for the response from the upper level people. I don’t have the authority to make the decision. We are going to have extra work volunteer available next week, will you do this?/nT: Yes, I would totally be willing to do that. /nA: I will refer you to the board for a raise. /nT: So you, are going to refer me for a raise?/nA: Yes. /nT: My goal isn’t to leave, I just think a little more compensation.","A: Hi/nT: Hi/nA: How are you?/nT: I’m doing well, how about yourself ? /nA: I’m pretty busy. /nT: Yeah, no, i mean, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. The reason that i actually want to meet with you. I was just about this project. I i noticed that, I think that there's a little bit of miscommunication between what we both expected each other as far as the project goes. /nA: Could you please explain. /nT:  Yeah, yeah. So i think that just you obviously were assigned group team leader, and i think that as that just i think that with some of the other members, just kind of being on your phone and just kind of acting, you know, a little withdrawn from the situation. I think that that's kind of set the example, and i think that's kind of the direction it's going. And, i mean, it makes total sense. You're busy, you know, you have a lot to look forward to in your future, and i mean, it makes sense. But i just think that when we're there, if we just decide to be there, i think that we could really rally/nA: So I should put more effort into the project?/nT: I'm just saying that when we're there, we were just there, and we just are able to kind of divvy up the work and kind of come to what we expect from each other. I think that it would make it a lot more clear.  And I think that just one thing that i expect, just with any group that i work with, is that when people are their they're actually their they're actually playing attention/nA: I haven’t been able to meet with you guys in the last few weeks. Maybe you could assign me some tasks. I don’t think I can type all the words, but I can share notes and propose guidelines. /nT: Yeah, no, i get what you're saying about not wanting to type just because, you know, obviously, group member, you have a lot to oversee. And so i think that if we just, they kind of divvy that up. Because if you're giving us your guidelines in your notes, then you know it just is semantics putting it on paper. /nA: I prefer to work on my own. I want less meetings. /nT: i get what you're saying. So you're saying, you know, group meetings, just assign it out. Then we'll just come together at the end, you know, last minute check, read over it. /nA: I can be the link between the group and the advisor. /nT: that would be big time, just kind of understanding what he expects from a group project. That's, really, you know, definitely valuable. And i think that just the only doing issue that I had. I just wasn't sure if your level of engagement was kind of turning the group into this. But i mean, it makes sense. If you say you're fine, just an off line type of guy. /nA: I can just show up and show my progress./nT: yeah, no, i think that that would be awesome. I’d say were on the same page as far as that goes?","A: Hi, how’s it going?/nT: I’m doing well how are you?/nA: I’m fine, what did you want to discuss today? it sounded important./nT: so i'm doing well, but i'm i wanted to discuss with you about the project that way have to accomplish. I feel like maybe if you put in a little bit more work, we could get it done quicker. /nA: I am going to graduate soon and I need to apply for a new school, so I don’t have enough time. /nT: Yeah, well, in order to graduate, you've got a complete this assignment. Life will be just easier if we both work together and we got all the work done in time and you have enough time to accomplish your application as well. /nA: I can understand that this is an import project, but I don’t need to get a really high score. /nT: So do you know when we can possibly, like, set up a time where we can work together somewhere, like in the library or at home? /nA: I may not be able to attend every meeting. /nT: Is it possible for you to set up any time out of your week just dedicated to this project, just like you in a couple hours would help go a long way, because the other team members are putting a lot of work, and we'd like to see that out of you as well./nA: I can give you advice and review the project for you maybe because my time is limited. /nT: I feel like that wouldn't be fair to to me and the other group members, because we put a lot of work for it. I don’t think just a review would be enough effort on your part. /nA: So what do you think would be a fair assignment or job?/nT:, i think we can assign you just say, a smaller segment of the project, but at least like having your input on one part of the project would be of great help to us./nA: Okay, so you will just assign me a smaller section? /nT: Yeah a smaller section./nA:  How about be the leader of the project, and assign jobs? I can do my part./nT: That sounds good. ","A: Hi, how is it going?/nT: I’m fine, I was hoping i was hoping to talk about her group project with you there's some problems that we need to fix right now. /nA: What kind of problems?/nT: i know you're probably really busy preparing for graduation but it would be great if you could accomplish some tasks. being a senior, your expertise would really go a long way in helping us finish this project. /nA: I’m am really busy because I am going to graduate and I need to apply to a new school. /nT: well some some of us did notice that you were pretty busy way just wanted you to have a chance to be able to work on this project i think you have a lot of insight that you would provide for us /nA: If you could be the leader of the project, it would be a really good experience. /nT: okay but i thought the professor assigned you as the team leader. /nA: I can be the leader or review your work. Time is limited for me, so I cannot do everything. /nT: so if we were to assign roles and do some of the tasks do you think you would be able to review that for us in time /nA: Yeah, reviewing will work. I cannot do really time-consuming work, but I can give insight on how to proceed. /nT: do you think you have time to be with us next week to work on this to just give us insight on what direction you're gonna take the project into and not participate in most of the work we can handle that but just your insight in how we should proceed with the next task./nA: Okay. In the future you can contact me with skype or something. /nT: would it be possible to schedule a meeting for next week something concrete so we are able to stick to that for next week that all the group members are going to attend so it's a full meeting/n A: yeah i think that would work /nT: okay is there any other way to contact you other than phone call or skype cause i know since you're busy if you're busy doing something else it would kind of be inappropriate for me to call you, especially if you're in class or in a meeting somewhere else, maybe setting up like an e mail system or, like a messaging system. /nA: That is all possible. I just want you to know that time is a limitation for me. /nT: I understand/nA: That will be great. /nT: We can set up a messaging app or a new email chain of some sort. So we can stay in communication and not having time constraint for you, but also maybe if at least once a week do you think that's a reasonable time for you meet with us or maybe once every two weeks in person? /nA:  I think that’s okay. /nT: With that, we would be able to accomplish our tasks and not be strained on our parts. Um, and kind of picking up the slack for it./nA: Yeah. I just want to make the schedule to be flexible. So that will work for me./nT: Thanks",0,0,"A: Hello, how is it going, why do you want to talk with me today? /nT: Uh, i was just wondering, um, if you've had a chance to work on the project it on your assigned part. /nA: Yeah, i also want to, well in the project. /nT: Yeah, so did you do your part, yet?

I can do my part./nT: That sounds good. ","A: Hi, so what brings you to my office?/nT: Hi sir, thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I know you must be busy, and i'm hoping, if you have the time, if we could talk about potentially of me getting a raise./nA: Why do you need a raise?/nT: I've been working here now for the past three years, very consistently, bringing in a lot of business, and last year I earned the highest productivity in the office. I was also employee of the month, and I think, on top of that, also taking on more work load than i've been assigned kind of proves that i deserve a raise /nA: So you are not satisfied with your current salary, what increase are you looking for?/nT: Yes, sir. I think, based on the amount, uh, level of my workload, i think fifteen percent raise would be ideal. /nA: Are you comparing different offers from other companies?/nT: i've done that and also just looking within the company, especially because i've taken a higher level. Like, filled in for higher level positions. And i think i'm capable of moving forward and upward in the company. /nA: Right now you are interested in moving to another company?/nT: No, i'm interested in moving upwards in our company. /nA: We have a standard procedure for applying for a raise in our company, do you do this?/nT: I transferred from my office in the us to this office. I think the process may have been a little bit different, but i think just the workload that i take while i've been here, it doesn't quite match the salary that i'm receiving now/nA: Just apply in the system and just wait for the response from the upper level people. I don’t have the authority to make the decision. We are going to have extra work volunteer available next week, will you do this?/nT: Yes, I would totally be willing to do that. /nA: I will refer you to the board for a raise. /nT: So you, are going to refer me for a raise?/nA: Yes. /nT: My goal isn’t to leave, I just think a little more compensation.","A: How are you/nT: pretty good about yourself?/nA: I’m pretty busy, I'm graduating this summer, so as you can tell. Thesis defense something like that./nT:  I just wanted to bing up our group project. So we've been having some issues recently, and you feel like you haven't been participating as fully as you could. And as a group, we're relying on, you, provide guidance and help us get through this. Some of us have felt that we're picking up the slack on your part, and we were just wondering whether there is any way you could add more to this project with this project. /nA: So could you please tell what is it that I could contribute to this project? What do you guys expect me to get some input? /nT: okay, so, for example, to some or our meanings, you have showed up late, and you don’t really add any value to these meetings. We see in class that you're paying attention and take diligent notes if you could bring those notes to our meetings./nA: so i should summarize them and share them with you guys. Maybe as a deadline to our meetings so our project we should present a report. I should be honest with you i literally don't have the time to finish all the details of the Report. So how about you guys like assign like a portion of the work?/nT: So that that is one approach. However, you've been assigned to the team leader, group leader. So and as a senior who has had experience in other classes with this. You’re the one who's close to professor and we're kind of relying on you to you to help push us through this. And if you say you don't have time, would it be possible to talk to the professor and potentially come up with a solution there. So where you're providing more help to this project? /nA: So you guys see me as a link between the group and the professor?  I understand that, so maybe i can be responsible for the communication between the group and the professor so maybe I can update to the professor our weekly meetings, and i can do that, but i don't really want to spend too much time on this report i can Like putting my insights with you guys. And I share my reviews and my understanding of the project, Maybe we can just meet  once, every two weeks, two weeks, or maybe just cancel the weekly meetings. I literally don’t have so much time every week with you guys. I can take, a portion of the work with you guys I can share with you guys all the time.  I don't want to spend so much time. I can share with you the coding skill, something like that research, ever be with you guys ? I really hope you are the major members working on this project because I’m graduating this summer, i only got i really don't need an a or and a minus. To pass this course just a medium level, I will be satisfied with this kind of result./nT:  Okay, however, the rest of us are not graduating, and we want to put in the effort team to get this a because it’s Still, it still matters for us. /nA: Okay. I can promise I can show up in our group meeting. And just assign me like light weight. I have a schedule. Whatever summary, just some guidelines I don't want to touch it on the bottom work, like the coding and literature review. Can you guys do that? /nT: Right. Yeah, you might have to do more than that, because so far, we’ve been picking up so much slack and it's tough for us, the sophomores have a little less experience. We can assign you work, and if you can't meet every week, we can, have you do a summary online with both your notes and your work. So i think that might a possible solution. But if we do assign you work. We appreciate you either complete it, or if find it to be too much and unfair. If you could communicate that to us, as soon as possible so we can adjust./nA:  Here’s what i'm going to do, I ‘m  going to put a little effort into this project with you guys. And so you understand. I'm the guy, going to next chapter in my life, and you guys are already expecting good results in this course. I did do my best in trying to catch up with you guys and to present my insights and I’m going to talk to my professor. Try to get engaged in this group. /nT: That works.","A: Hello how is it going?/nT: I’m doing well, it was good seeing you. I wanna talk to you about a group project. I feel like we were not able to meet the needs that wanted to just one discussed to you about how we can do better. /nA: I’m the senior student and I am graduating this summer, so I am pretty busy, what would you like to do?/nT: Yeah, i mean, obviously, like you said, i know you're really busy preparing for graduation and everything, but i think it would be great if you could help accomplish at least some of the tasks. being a senior, I know, like your expertise after studying for four years, would be really helpful and would go a really long way to helping us finish his project. /nA: I can give you some insight, can we schedule a weekly meeting. /nT: Yeah, definitely, the only thing I noticed is that because you are always so busy. Uh, you never tend to respond whatever we hold meetings, and because of those reasons it’s been kind of hard to just keep up with everything. So it would be better if you could make sure that everyone can attend/nA: If you assign me several tasks and give me a deadline, I can do them. I cannot show up for every meeting. /nT: Yeah I think we could definitely give you some tasks that you can finish, but I also think its important to me at some point, so that the team could get a holistic view, because, obviously we can learn from whatever you have to say as well. But we can definitely give you things how you think we can make sure that you actually do finish whatever we assigned you to?/nA: You can set deadlines and I can send you my work. You can maybe meet without me./nT: Like you said, you are graduating and this class also important, obviously, to graduating, so it would also help if you could just show some more support, as we're going through it as well. /nA: I can contribute as much as I can but you may have to help me a little bit more on this project. You guys are productive, so you can help me. /nT: I think the biggest thing is that since it is us four working on it,  It makes more sense that all four divvy up all the work, twenty five per cent each, especially because again it’s a group party, that we should be working on together regardless of how much older or where the group leader is. If we are the ones assigned to do the work, all four of us should be working together. So of course, we can give you a fourth of it to do. We can give to you online so we can work on it in google docs or something, and you have to meet every single time. It is important that you do at least a fourth of the work, and then i'll finish it off by the deadlines we assign. /nA: I can show my progress, maybe you guys could not push me so hard on the meetings. /nT: Because obviously you won’t be able to show up to every meeting, I think it’s also most important, that the meetings that you to show up to that to also act in a very productive manner, like not being on your phone or not on social media the entire time. Rather if we are meeting for two hours. Let's, just crank that for those two hours, and then you obviously don't have to stay for longer than that, but just so that we can get, you get the work done and just not have to worry about it.","A: Hello, how are you?/nT: I'm doing well, it is good to see you. I wanted to talk about her project. I feel like we're not where we need to be and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that. /nA: Sounds important. So what in particular?/nT: i know you're probably really busy with preparing for graduation, but it would be great if you could accomplish some task being a senior, your expertise would really go a long way in helping us finish this project /nA: So what do you want me to do? /nT: I i haven't seen you at meetings in a while and it's been hard keep hard to keep up with the project because the full team hasn't been there. /nA: Okay, so, you know, and am going to graduate from school, so i think it's probably hard for me to join every meeting. Can we discuss the project in another way?/nT: It's not that it's like you haven't been but only you only missed a few you've missed a large amount of our meetings i like you like even though you might be graduating we are not like as team leader you took the responsibility of leading us and helping us and guiding us and like you haven't really been doing that like i'm sorry if that sounds rude, it’s just like this like our grades are still dependent on this project and like we're not all graduating so like if like your input is really affecting our grade /nA: I still need the credit of this course and of course but um as you know i probably don't have too much time to put our put it i can’t promise that I can put in that much time on the project. /nT: even if you can't like show for each meeting like please at least let us know so that we could like least like let you know what you can do because like i guess like there has been like a lot of miscommunication here and like um you aren’t like notifying us when you don't come i'm like way we just really appreciate it and like for at least there'd be like a legitimate excuse like i know senioritis is like a very big thing but like as well like as i said like our grade is still dependent on this like at our gpa is like still very dependent on this /nA: You know that I am the leader, and I can be in contact with the professor, so I can give you some ideas on the project, but I cannot go through every detail of the project. /nT: I think as a member of this team is like all equal responsibility it shouldn't be more or less i think because it's like you decided to join this group and you burdened the responsibility and like we all have that same responsibility all of us are busy with clubs extracurriculars, other classes like i don't think anyone is too busy for this one class and so i think even if you got, like, one hour like less one hour off like less sleep in the night like you should be pulling equal weight as the rest of us /nA: I understand, I can do my part, but you could contact me another way. /nT: i think, yeah, like honestly, like maybe meeting meeting in person is always necessary. It might be necessary near, the end of the project, but like if there is, like, a constant, like flow of communication and like we are miss communicating, we like delegated tasks like relatively quickly, like i honestly don't think it will be that much work or like that much of a burden. So, like, i think, as long as we're still texting, communicating somehow, then we will be good. /nA: I can give you my schedule and we can work around that. /nT:  uh, yeah, most definitely, I think like communication is the key for us to like, getting a good grade on this project. /nA: Yeah, yeah","A: Hello, how is it going, what do you want to talk about? /nT: yeah, i'm doing well, it's, nice to see you. I wanted to talk to you about the group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to talk to you about how we can get there. /nA: Sure, we can discuss this. /nT: Yeah. Um, you're probably busy with your senior plans and preparing for graduation. But it would be awesome if you could help us, like finishing the project because you’re a senior and you probably have a lot to offer. /nA: I am busy with graduation and job interviews. I have worked hard for the part four years. My expertise can help us to do better./nT: Yeah. Yeah. Do you think you'd have any free time to kind of work on the project? Are you busy all the time?/nA: I can spend some time, but I cannot guarantee how much time I can spend on it. /nT:  Okay, so we all need to eat. So how about we meet up to, get dinner sometime, and we can work on the project together with the group so We can start moving along and like, see where we are. /nA: When?/nT: When are you free? Tomorrow for dinner? /nA: I am in DC for two or three days. /nT: How about after you come back, lunch, dinner, any day. /nA: The proposal is due in two or three days. I think if you wait for me we will not be able to finish it on time. /nT: Would you be able to meet up over Hangout or something, we could just discuss what's going on, and i can write some of it down. We really need your ideas and i could just write everything else down./n A: What do you mean?/nT: What, like, just like a video Hang out or something where we could just call on the phone or something and just talk about the ideas that we need to turn in. /nA: Yeah, that will work. So I can give you guidance, but we need to write a three thousand word paper, but I cannot guarantee that I can write a lot of words. I can write four hundred. /nT: okay, that's Fine. We can all take on an extra twenty words or something. That's not a big deal, if you could only get five hundred done. That's fine. /nA: When are we going to meet for the first time?/nT:, if you can't make it to any of the meetings, we could just try to call you in. And then we'll meet up. If it's happened, it's happening when you’re in DC or something. And then after that, we can use a doodle poll to see when everybody else is free and get that fixed./nA: How about tomorrow. /nT: That is fine, we I can check with the other group members. /nA: I hope everyone can attend. /nT: Yeah, i hope so. If they can't, we can just update them in later and give them the details/nA: I can submit the paper to the professor to look at it to get feedback so you can make more modifications./nT: we can start a group chat and then discuss ideas. And then maybe you can have some input while we're writing it. So we can have that input first. And then we can also meet the professor, so, like you kind of, can use your expertise to help. ","A: Hello, how’s it going?/nT: hi, um, i'm actually not great, project that we're currently working on is kind of stressing me out, and i was actually hoping i could talk to you about that. /nA:  Sure, sure. So what in particular? /nT: Um, well, i just think that, um, at this point, we're a little behind, and it feels like the rest of the group members are doing a lot of the work, and it feels like you haven't really been present or contributing much. So we're hoping to contribute more. /nA: Sure. So, like what exactly you want me to do for the project? /nT: so i think it would just be good if you first of all, just came to our group meeting so when we split up the work evenly, you would be there and like know each of us. Um, and then also, just like, if you could just do each of our parts on time, because we need that to further move along in the project. /nA: As you know, I’m a senior, and I’m going to graduate from this school? So I probably don’t have too much time to put in on the project. I hope you understand that, you know. I probably can’t attend regular meetings, is that okay?/nT: That’s not great, because i think the rest of us are sophomores. And we have a lot to do as well.  Like i understand, you're graduating. But i still think it's important to come to the meetings. And if you don't come to meetings because you have, like something because you're a senior, that you have to go to, I think at the very least, you know, you could send us a message. And we could tell you what we need. To do help us further along the project/nA: Ok sure, just maybe go ahead by text or email. Because I really don’t have enough time./nT: Yeah, as long as you think you'll be pretty responsive with that. /nA: Okay sure, I definitely respond to that. And as you know I probably don’t have enough time to work on the project, so probably, I can give you some ideas or opinions from the professor because I’m in contact with the professor, and also I’m the leader of the project, so probably I can give you some ideas, or I can tell you how to go on the project/nT: I think at this point, like we have enough ideas and we know where to go. We just kind of get it done. So the rest of us already feel like we've been putting in a lot and it's like a burden, because we have other things to do, too. So i think you'd be more helpful if you just actually did the work instead of just you asking, contributing ideas, because i think we're done with that. /nA: Okay, but um, Maybe we can just, instead of meeting every week, or regularly, I think we can finish the report on the Google Doc instead of meeting. /nT: yeah actually, i think that might work. Um, i think what we could do is set a date. And then, if we like let's, say by this friday, everyone's parts are up on the google Doc, and everyone thinks that that's enough that i don't think we need to meet again. But if not that, i do think it's important to meet, just so we all know. You know what, page we are all on./nA: Ok sure, that works for me","A: Hello, why do you want to talk with me today. /nT: i'm doing well. It is good to see you. I wanted to talk about our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i want to discuss with you about how we can improve that./nA: Sure./nT: I know you're really probably really busy preparing for graduation, but it would be great, if you could accomplish some tasks, being a senior, your expertise would really go a long way in helping us finish this project. /nA: I have been working hard for the last four years, so I am the leader of the project, but I am busy so I am not always available. /nT: Well, i feel like as you’re team leader, if you could at least give us some advice or just directions to go, and we would be happy to continue the work. We just want you to have input. I think you have great insight, so i think that would help the team. /nA: I will be glad to give directions, but I can not do much practical work. We cannot divide the report equally, so I need to do a smaller portion. /nT: Yeah, i think i think that's a great point. I think even if you put in the four hundred words I think that we could make something work./nA:  You can do more work, should we work together at the meetings, or should we find another way to work?/nT: if need be, we could work as a group and kind of take like which part of the project that we want to work on. So if you want to do the intro and start us off really well, then we can assign different parts to different team members. /nA: I will assign the work in a meeting and then you should do more work and sent it to me and I will ask the professor for feedback. /nT: But I thought we just decided you would do four hundred and we would all do six hundred. /nA: Any questions about that? /nT: Yeah, yeah, and if you could help us like this, prepare for the professor, and get feedback from professor. I think that you would definitely be doing your part. /nA: Sure, I will do that. /nT: Yeah, that sounds great. /nA: We can start to work soon. /nT: That sounds great, Thank you","A: How is it going?/nT: Good how are you?/nA: I am good, what did you want to talk about?/nT: Yeah, i just wanted to talk our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to discuss how we can improve that. /nA: What kind of problem do we have?/nT: I just i mean, i'm sure you're really busy with graduation going on right now, but i think you have a lot of insight since you're the senior, and i think your expertise would really help us in finishing our project. /nA: Time is limited because I am really busy, how should we solve this problem?/nT: You are really busy, so i think just maybe we can work around the time that you're free and we can all meet up together so we can work on the project./nA: I cannot always meet, can we use Skype or something?/nT: Yeah, sure. If you think that would work better for you than we can definitely do that, we just wanted to. We just need your insights so that we can finish the project. /nA: Do you want to be the leader?/nT: Oh, if you don't mind then, I can go ahead and do that. If you feel alright with that?/nA: That would be great. Being a leader will be time consuming. /nT: Should we check in with the teacher first before we do that?/nA: Yeah sure. /n","A: Hi how’s it going?/nT: I’m doing well, it's good to see you./nA:  What do you want to talk to me about today?/nT: i wanted to talk about our group project i feel like we're not on the same page and where we need to be and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that /nA: What is wrong with the project?/nT: the group and i just feel that we've had a lot to shoulders and we're hoping that you would take on some more work /nA: I’m really busy recently and time is limited, so I don’t have that much time to work on the project. /nT: i know time could be really tough but we feel like because you're a senior if you contributed your insight and your experience would be a lot of help in completing our project and because you're our team leader and think it would go even further /nA: I would like to offer some help, but I think if you could be a kind of leader and assign jobs and tasks it would be really helpful. /nT: but you were assigned the leader position by the professor /nA: Okay, what about you can do some work and I can review the work. /nT: i think i like where that's going, but i feel like it's still end up being to a point where, like, like, the three of us will end up doing all the work, and then you just review it, right ? We need you, maybe not spearhead, but definitely contribute more significantly. /nA: Okay, uh uh, maybe i cannot meet you personally every time you can use skype. Or you can call me, /nT: Yeah we can video conference, or whatever it is, just like we want you to have a more direct input into, like all the work we're doing and make sure you're even if we can't work at the same time. If we need to meet over video call or something, at least the work has your presence in it. /nA: Ok, I will try to do that. /nT: Thank you","A; Hello how is it going?/nT: I’m good how are you?/nA: I’m good, what did you want to talk about today?/nT: I was wondering if you would be able to help out contributing to the group project more? Me being a sophomore, I’m really struggling and I think a senior’s output would really helpful to me. /nA: What in particular/nT: Maybe advice on different perspectives, like since you have a lot more experience and stuff maybe you can help me finish this project in a different way like create a spin to it. /nA: Of course I can help you, but as you know I’m busy/nT: Yeah, of course, we don’t have to meet or anything, we could honestly just text about it or anything. That would be ideal so you don’t have to waste so much time since you are a senior and texting is really convenient too. /nA: We need to finish the report. /nT: Honestly, if you were to just give me some input, I just need some input on your behalf on what we should do. /nA: I can talk to the professor. /nT: That would be great, and also, I’m not asking for too much, but a little more contribution would be great. I know you are a senior and stuff but we just need to get this this project done as quickly as possible.","A: Hello, how’s it going?/nT: Good, how are you? /nA: I’m good, so what did you want to talk with me about?/nT: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about our group project, I think we we're just like a little bit behind that. You're busy, and i'm busy. You definitely have graduation and stuff, so so i was wondering if we get, like, find a better time, to meet up that works for all of us. /nA: So you think we’re a little behind on schedule?/nT: Yeah, we're a little behind on schedule. I personally have some other assignments I have to get done later on, so it might be easier if we could get more work done efficiently./nA: Uh, so as you know I am going to graduate from the university, so I probably do not have enough time to put in on the project /nT: yeah, i totally get that. I just don't want a situation where we're all busy. And then we dropped the ball on the front, affect your grade and my grade. You probably need a good grade on this to help on your transcript for resumes and stuff /nA: It is indeed import for me to get credit from this course, but it’s like I don’t have enough time to meet especially for a regular meeting, I can’t attend a regular meeting, that’s the situation./nT: Yeah, that totally makes sense. Even if you can't attend full group meetings, if you want, because we have a three thousand Maybe we can all do a back and forth just when you have free time, you can add a little bit and we can use, like a google docs. That way, we can just kind of keep up with what each other is doing. That way, we don't have to meet in person, if it's harder. /nA: I think that works for me, but as you can see the effort I can put in on this project is very small, so it would be helpful to use the google docs to work more efficiently /nT: Yeah, we could just use a google, doc. And that if anyone has any questions or confusion about what the other person is doing we can just either communicate through messaging or meet in person if we have to. That way, we can all kind of keep track. ","A: Hello, how’s it going?/nT: hi, um, i'm actually not great, project that we're currently working on is kind of stressing me out, and i was actually hoping i could talk to you about that. /nA:  Sure, sure. So what in particular? /nT: Um, well, i just think that, um, at this point, we're a little behind, and it feels like the rest of the group members are doing a lot of the work, and it feels like you haven't really been present or contributing much.

You definitely have graduation and stuff, so so i was wondering if we get, like, find a better time, to meet up that works for all of us. /nA: So you think we’re a little behind on schedule?/nT: Yeah, we're a little behind on schedule. I personally have some other assignments I have to get done later on, so it might be easier if we could get more work done efficiently./nA: Uh, so as you know I am going to graduate from the university, so I probably do not have enough time to put in on the project /nT: yeah, i totally get that. I just don't want a situation where we're all busy. And then we dropped the ball on the front, affect your grade and my grade. You probably need a good grade on this to help on your transcript for resumes and stuff /nA: It is indeed import for me to get credit from this course, but it’s like I don’t have enough time to meet especially for a regular meeting, I can’t attend a regular meeting, that’s the situation./nT: Yeah, that totally makes sense. Even if you can't attend full group meetings, if you want, because we have a three thousand Maybe we can all do a back and forth just when you have free time, you can add a little bit and we can use, like a google docs. That way, we can just kind of keep up with what each other is doing. That way, we don't have to meet in person, if it's harder. /nA: I think that works for me, but as you can see the effort I can put in on this project is very small, so it would be helpful to use the google docs to work more efficiently /nT: Yeah, we could just use a google, doc. And that if anyone has any questions or confusion about what the other person is doing we can just either communicate through messaging or meet in person if we have to. That way, we can all kind of keep track. ","A: How is it going?/nT: Good how are you?/nA: I am good, what did you want to talk about?/nT: Yeah, i just wanted to talk our group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to discuss how we can improve that. /nA: What kind of problem do we have?/nT: I just i mean, i'm sure you're really busy with graduation going on right now, but i think you have a lot of insight since you're the senior, and i think your expertise would really help us in finishing our project. /nA: Time is limited because I am really busy, how should we solve this problem?/nT: You are really busy, so i think just maybe we can work around the time that you're free and we can all meet up together so we can work on the project./nA: I cannot always meet, can we use Skype or something?/nT: Yeah, sure. If you think that would work better for you than we can definitely do that, we just wanted to. We just need your insights so that we can finish the project. /nA: Do you want to be the leader?/nT: Oh, if you don't mind then, I can go ahead and do that. If you feel alright with that?/nA: That would be great. Being a leader will be time consuming. /nT: Should we check in with the teacher first before we do that?/nA: Yeah sure. /n","A; Hello how is it going?/nT: I’m good how are you?/nA: I’m good, what did you want to talk about today?/nT: I was wondering if you would be able to help out contributing to the group project more? Me being a sophomore, I’m really struggling and I think a senior’s output would really helpful to me. /nA: What in particular/nT: Maybe advice on different perspectives, like since you have a lot more experience and stuff maybe you can help me finish this project in a different way like create a spin to it. /nA: Of course I can help you, but as you know I’m busy/nT: Yeah, of course, we don’t have to meet or anything, we could honestly just text about it or anything. That would be ideal so you don’t have to waste so much time since you are a senior and texting is really convenient too. /nA: We need to finish the report. /nT: Honestly, if you were to just give me some input, I just need some input on your behalf on what we should do. /nA: I can talk to the professor. /nT: That would be great, and also, I’m not asking for too much, but a little more contribution would be great. I know you are a senior and stuff but we just need to get this this project done as quickly as possible.","A: Hello, how is it going, what do you want to talk about? /nT: yeah, i'm doing well, it's, nice to see you. I wanted to talk to you about the group project. I feel like we're not where we need to be, and i wanted to talk to you about how we can get there. /nA: Sure, we can discuss this. /nT: Yeah. Um, you're probably busy with your senior plans and preparing for graduation. But it would be awesome if you could help us, like finishing the project because you’re a senior and you probably have a lot to offer. /nA: I am busy with graduation and job interviews. I have worked hard for the part four years. My expertise can help us to do better./nT: Yeah. Yeah. Do you think you'd have any free time to kind of work on the project? Are you busy all the time?/nA: I can spend some time, but I cannot guarantee how much time I can spend on it. /nT:  Okay, so we all need to eat. So how about we meet up to, get dinner sometime, and we can work on the project together with the group so We can start moving along and like, see where we are. /nA: When?/nT: When are you free? Tomorrow for dinner? /nA: I am in DC for two or three days. /nT: How about after you come back, lunch, dinner, any day. /nA: The proposal is due in two or three days. I think if you wait for me we will not be able to finish it on time. /nT: Would you be able to meet up over Hangout or something, we could just discuss what's going on, and i can write some of it down. We really need your ideas and i could just write everything else down./n A: What do you mean?/nT: What, like, just like a video Hang out or something where we could just call on the phone or something and just talk about the ideas that we need to turn in. /nA: Yeah, that will work. So I can give you guidance, but we need to write a three thousand word paper, but I cannot guarantee that I can write a lot of words. I can write four hundred. /nT: okay, that's Fine. We can all take on an extra twenty words or something. That's not a big deal, if you could only get five hundred done. That's fine. /nA: When are we going to meet for the first time?/nT:, if you can't make it to any of the meetings, we could just try to call you in. And then we'll meet up. If it's happened, it's happening when you’re in DC or something. And then after that, we can use a doodle poll to see when everybody else is free and get that fixed./nA: How about tomorrow. /nT: That is fine, we I can check with the other group members. /nA: I hope everyone can attend. /nT: Yeah, i hope so. If they can't, we can just update them in later and give them the details/nA: I can submit the paper to the professor to look at it to get feedback so you can make more modifications./nT: we can start a group chat and then discuss ideas. And then maybe you can have some input while we're writing it. So we can have that input first. And then we can also meet the professor, so, like you kind of, can use your expertise to help. ","A: Hi how’s it going?/nT: I’m doing well, it's good to see you./nA:  What do you want to talk to me about today?/nT: i wanted to talk about our group project i feel like we're not on the same page and where we need to be and i wanted to discuss with you on how we can improve that /nA: What is wrong with the project?/nT: the group and i just feel that we've had a lot to shoulders and we're hoping that you would take on some more work /nA: I’m really busy recently and time is limited, so I don’t have that much time to work on the project. /nT: i know time could be really tough but we feel like because you're a senior if you contributed your insight and your experience would be a lot of help in completing our project and because you're our team leader and think it would go even further /nA: I would like to offer some help, but I think if you could be a kind of leader and assign jobs and tasks it would be really helpful. /nT: but you were assigned the leader position by the professor /nA: Okay, what about you can do some work and I can review the work. /nT: i think i like where that's going, but i feel like it's still end up being to a point where, like, like, the three of us will end up doing all the work, and then you just review it, right ? We need you, maybe not spearhead, but definitely contribute more significantly. /nA: Okay, uh uh, maybe i cannot meet you personally every time you can use skype. Or you can call me, /nT: Yeah we can video conference, or whatever it is, just like we want you to have a more direct input into, like all the work we're doing and make sure you're even if we can't work at the same time. If we need to meet over video call or something, at least the work has your presence in it. /nA: Ok, I will try to do that. /nT: Thank you",0.0,0.0
