We know that you're very busy, but we were just maybe, if we could all meet up again and maybe talk about dividing the tasks up just to keep each other accountable, and i don't mind shoulder a little bit of extra work.

And but you know that in our company, I don't have all the authority to make a final decision about your salary. Maybe i should. I should discuss with my upper manager, first/nT: i can show them all the work that i've been doing with past couple of months. I believe they would be impressed,/nA:  but i know that for our company I will give you a positive evaluation and take your request to the upper management. But before that, i don't advise you to directly talk with him, and maybe, uh, tomorrow morning, i will go to his office to talk with him. But one thing i want to make sure that i cannot guarantee that you will soon get a pay raise. But i support your request. /nT: I appreciate the, uh, support and, um, thank you for the consideration, and i wouldn't go above your head. /nA: And also, even if your request is approved, we cannot get a pay raise right now. Maybe it takes sometimes to take into effect. Maybe two or three months or something like that. Also, chances are that maybe your request may not be approved. What if that happened?/nT:  Um, that happened, um then i think you just does what i could do in the future. So that way I could be considered for a raise. /nA: Have you considered about finding a job at other companies? /nT:  In other companies? i haven't considered that. But if you feel that that's, the only way for me to excel my career, then i might have to consider that in the future./nA: You know that our company may a little bit different. We are now having a hard time because no, because president trump, due to president trump’s regulation, we have to pay more taxes than before. I hope you can understand it. /nT: Yeah, no, i definitely understand, um, and i hope that we can work together to come to a conclusion. /nA: Yeah, so, uh, Maybe tomorrow I can discuss with upper management first, and I will give any feedback from them and during the process. I hope you can still work as good as before to make our company better. /nT: Thank you. Appreciate it, I’ll keep working hard. /nA: Is there anything else. /nT: No, thank you./nA:  thank you, bye",0.0,"A: Hello, come in. Why did you want to talk to me today? The problem with your work?/nT: No, sir, I just wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have a open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Sure, i'm open to that./nT: I’ve done a lot of good things with company. Lead many projects, brought in a lot of business company and taking a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: I have seen the work you bring to the table, and I think there is potential for you to get a raise. /nT:  You ask anyone in the office, including upper management, about my work ethic, I work harder than almost anyone. /nA: Actually, I cannot give you a raise just because you think you work the hardest. We have to give raises based on the evaluation of the whole department. /nT: you'd ask your upper management before you give me a raise? Is that correct? /nA: I don’t have the authority to talk to them. /nT: yeah, yeah, okay, so would you be able to talk to them at some point this quarter? /nA: You mean now? /nT: No. Now, whenever it's, convenient for you, I know you’re very busy and are doing a lot of things for the company but if you could talk to them this quarter about my work and if I deserve a pay raise, it would go a long way for me. /nA: before i talk, could you give me more reasons you deserve a raise?/nT: Well, like i've reiterated earlier i brought on a lot of business for the company, i take a lot of extra projects and for those reasons. I do believe i am eligible for a higher pay raise seeing as I've received numerous times to play the month, high productivity rate, and i have even applied numerous times for higher management/nA: Our company is having a hard time right now, because because we have to pay extra taxes due to donald trump's policies right now, I appreciate your past work, but i think that maybe your chances of getting a pay raise are not so great right now. /nT: I understand that. I do appreciate your feedback, but it would go a long way from me if you could at least try and know you're busy. But if you could take a few minutes out of your busy schedule to talk to the higher ups about it I would really appreciate it. Just put that seed in their mind, so when the economy does get better, they have me on their mind/nA: I will talk to my upper management soon. /nT: thank you so much so i really do appreciate it if you could let me know how that conversation goes that would be great /nA: One thing I want to make clear is that even if I have talked to my upper management and tell them about you request, I cannot guarantee that you will get a pay raise immediately. /nT: i understand that i don't need the pay raise immediately just the appreciation that the sign that will you ask for them and they wanted to give a pay raise whenever it would come in and it would be very beneficial to me so i completely understand the situation /nA: yeah sure i just i really appreciate your understanding to work in this process because maybe you know that's for chinese company the process is a little different from that in America. If the company is having a hard time, it may be harder to get a pay raise./nT: Okay, I did not know that i'm still very new to the culture of chinese companies. So from, like from now, what is the correct way for an employee to seek out a raise if you can’t do it directly? /nA: I just want you. I just want you. You two know the cultural difference. But since since you have you have, you have since we have come out with your request. I will give it to the upper management/nT: Thank you, sir for your time. I appreciate it.",0,"A: Hi, you said you wanted to meet today, is there a problem with your work?/nT: no ma'am no problem at all i was just wondering if we could have open conversation about increasing my salary/nA: Why do you want to increase you salary?/nT:  i've been here for several years now i have received a lot of employee of the month awards stood in for higher ups quite a few times and i work extremely hard for this company i just feel my salary is not reflective of the good work i have been doing/nA: We appreciate your work, but the effort that the effort and the time you put in to work cannot be related to us directly to salary. /nT i would very much like a raise there will be nice to actually get some momentum going with my career here in the company i was hoping by coming here i could maybe step it up and no start making more money and i feel i just feel that i've worked very hard to earn that /nA: Do you want to increase your salary or position?/nT: if there is a higher position i could take. That would be amazing. But i would be perfectly content just increasing my current salary with my current position as well. /nA: Increasing salary is a serious issue, you need to prove that to me. /nT:  Well, i mean, i think all of my past work has definitely shown that and you said that based on the results of my work. I think if we look back in the books projects i have worked on, i believe they are more than up to par when considering a raise. So i believe that shows that i earned it. /nA: I am not an upper level manager, so I need to talk to upper level managers. /nT:  In terms of money there's never needed in my opinion but i would like to make progress i need to make progress otherwise i don't believe i would be able to stay with this company because we all want to progress in life, we all want to make sure that we're moving forward i think by earning in the past employee of the month awards repeatedly doing the work of many people around me and just overall just working hard every day that i show up i just i believe that the work in the past that i've done will show to the other managers that you have to talk to about it i think it will clearly show i am deserving of it./nA: The future of our company is promising, it will be great if you can work with us into the future. There are many uncertainties. /nT: well in that case what i would ask of you is uh like you said, you have to talk to other managers about increasing a salary so all i would ask is maybe if you could present my past work, or just present the fact that i have worked very hard to higher ups and other managers, and maybe they would look at it, and i would have sooner rather than later possibility and increasing my salary. /nA: We enjoy working with you. I want you to stay with up. /nT:. All righty. Well, thank you very much, that's, really all i can ask you appreciate that. ","A: hi, what do you want to meet me today, is there a problem with your work?/nT: Oh, you know, actually, i'm really happy with my work here. I've loved working here like the past ten years. Uh, i was just hoping to talk to you about something. Um, i, you know, i've been working here for the past ten years. Um, have won numerous awards. Um, i've increased our companies productivity. And actually, i earned the highest productivity in the last year. I think i've been really beneficial to this company. And i was hoping that after these ten years, it is time for me to get a raise. /nA: You mean a raise in your salary or position /nT: raise my salary yes /nA: Could you explain more about why it is time to ask for a raise?/nT: absolutely yeah um so basically i just started a family uh about three years ago and my kids are going into pre-school and uh i've been working really hard for this company and everything that i've ever done has been for the betterment of this company i haven't cut corners i've been true to the company's values i've been working every single day i'm never sick um but i want to send my kids to a really good preschool /nA: Family is a common issue when asking for a raise, you put great effort, but it is not directly related to the salary. Your working results are also important. /nT: yeah i understand what you're saying i just what have you seen for me in the past ten years that you would hate to see let's go away? /nA: You work hard and we would like to work with you in the future. /nT: i think i would really like to keep working with you but i do need to get a raise and if i don't see potential for getting a raise anytime soon here i might have to leave and go seek employment other places because i'm just worried that i'm not going to be able to send my kids to a good school and for me work has taken a priority in my life but now that i have kids their priority in my life and i understand that you from an economic standpoint can't necessarily divert funds to giving raises to people just because of family reasons but i know that my work has been far superior to that of my peers and that i have a deep love for this company and i know that i would hate to go and i hope that you would hate to see me go but i really need a raise /nA: I am not the only person who can make the final decision, I need to talk to a higher-level manager. /nT: Yeah, that would be i was going to ask you if you'd be willing to do that. And, um, lobby for my case, i would really appreciate that. /nA: Is this urgent?/nT: i mean they're just going into preschool so i'd say within the next six months would be a reasonable time frame in order to get a raise because i understand that you will have to make adjustments within the company i understand that you can't just pull money out of nowhere and uh in order to get a raise you'll have to give me more money would just taking money from somewhere else so of course i would be happy to have it happened over a period of time /nA: If we cannot give you a raise, will you leave the company?/nT: i think that if within the next six months i don't hear from you again about it i'm going to come back in and talk to you about it obviously but i think we should proceed from there and at which point i may be considering other employment options. /nA: Okay, so maybe we need to discuss this problem later. /nT: Yeah, well, we i think that it's important that you discuss it with you you need to discuss it with now but you and i can discuss it later. Once you hear back from the decision the upper management made okay. /nA: Ok I will let you know what I hear. /nT: Thank you so much.","A: hi, what do you want to meet me today, is there a problem with your work?/nT: Oh, you know, actually, i'm really happy with my work here.

I feel like i've done a lot of good work for the company in the past year, especially, and having been here for three years, i've done a lot of work to lead many projects and brought a lot of good business to the company. So i felt like i've taken on a lot of extra work and I deserve the raise./nA: Our company has a standard process for applying for a raise. Why did you want to talk with me?/nT: Um, well, i felt like i can show them all the work, and i could tell them all the things that i've done. But at the end, like, aren’t you the one who will have the final say, so it's Easier to come directly to you/nA: Actually, i don't have the authority to make the final decision.

What if your request is not approved?/nT: then i'd honestly like to request to talk to your higher up because i feel like i have proven my worth to this company and i think i can not only show that, but i can also talk about that, especially with the higher ups because i feel like i'm deserving of this /nA: You can do that. Have you received offers at other companies?/nT: Um i haven't really considered working at any other company i really like the job here. So i'm i'm honestly just banking on this salary raise because i really like the work that i do here and hopefully the work i'm doing here has been benefiting the company./nA: okay Sure, i appreciate your honesty I will talk with my upper management and give you feedback. /nT: Sounds good. Thank you","A: Hi, uh, why do you want to meet me today, are there any problems relating to your work? /nT: No, no, no, no. Um, i wanted to actually discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation about potentially increasing my salery. /nA: Oh, um, why do you ask about it at this time point? /nT: So i personally believe that i've done a lot of good things for this company, such as leading many projects, bringing lots of business to the company, and i've taken on a lot of extra work that wasn't necessarily assigned to. /nA: So you believe you deserve a raising salary ? /nT: Yes, indeed, i do. Um, in fact, i feel like you could ask anyone in the office, including upper management, about my work ethic. And i believe that i worked harder than almost anyone. /nA: First of all, i have to say i think that there are other people working really hard, but i also enjoy working with you but from the perspective of manager i have to say the raise in salary is a pretty complicated process i have to discuss with higher managements so i cannot decided at this time /nT: what aren't you the one who has the final say? i don't understand why we would why you would need thio discuss this with upper management. like i said earlier, you could ask anyone in the office including upper management about my work ethic and i think they definitely back /nA: what do you think what you are saying that you work hard you did a great job yeah, pretty much agree with that but did a good job not equal to raising your salary like i said, salary is a pretty complicated thing, and not only for you working hard and also related to the conditions of our company you. know what I’m saying? /nT: i understand i understand and i definitely i respect that, but i just think that i'm asking to just think about raising the salary considering that i've been working here for three years, i've never had any problems i've won numerous employee of the month awards as well as earning the highest productivity rate in the office last year and considering that i have filled in for higher management numerous times, i believe that the current salary i have doesn't reflect accurately what i'm capable of doing, /nA: yeah, but like i said, the prospective employees and employer are different. But i believe that you did a great job. But i have to say that our company has a really promising future. We're going to develop a lot of other business. So i believe you have a great future working here. But when it comes to salary, even if i discussed with someone else, some other, managers in our company, and it might still take a pretty long time to make a final decision, do you think that is acceptable to you ?/nT: Can you can you explain a little bit more ? /nA: Yeah, i mean, even if i decided to okay, we began the discussion to give you a higher salary. It might take, like, a year or few months to make a final decision. Do you think that will work for you? Is it urgent /nT: I would definitely wouldn't say it's very urgent, but i would i would appreciate if we could just get get it into the talks and just thinking about, like, raising my salary, considering i've been working for the past three years, maybe, like, on my fourth year of working, i would expect, not expect, but i would appreciate ah, higher raise a raise. Um, but i do understand that is a long process. /nA: Yeah, uh, great, you can understand that, and i think there's. One more thing to discuss. If you cannot get a higher salary in this year, do you consider a change of company ? /nT: No, because i definitely think, considering the way how open you are, of discussing the possibility of a raise that i could come back next year or the year after that. And try to, you know, discuss the higher salary when the future, when the company is going to be doing much better. And when i will be more much more experienced than too /nA: yeah, sounds good. /nT: Cool. Thanks.","A: Hello, what brings you to my office?/nT: hi sir. I actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: You are not satisfied with your salary./nT: I feel as though i've done a lot for the company. I've led many projects and brought in a lot of business. Have a lot of work that was not assigned to me /nA: You think you deserve a higher salary?/nT: I feel as though the amount of work that i've taken on isn't reflective of my current salary./nA: What amount of salary increase do you desire?/nT: i believe i should get a fifteen percent. /nA: We have a standard procedure for getting a promotion, have you used the system?/nT: I have not done that. /nA: Why did you want to talk to me, do you want me to pull strings for you? /nT: my apology I was not aware of that there was another way to do this. /nA: I think you have potential to get a raise, I think you should apply in our system for a raise. I can talk to the supervisor about your situation. Are you considering offers from other companies. /nT: No/nA: You are not considering other offers, so you have loyalty to our company, we are going to do extra work in advertising, will you be willing to help out. /nT: I would be willing to help out the company. /nA: We need extra people, there will be no compensation. /nT: I understand. /nA: We can go through the standard procedure, we can’t have a final decision today. /nT: Thank you, I appreciate the help, Is there anything i can do to improve my case with the supervisor?/n A: Be carful with your materials in the application. /nT: Thank you for the help. I will complete the application. ","A: Hi, uh, why do you want to meet me today, are there any problems relating to your work? /nT: No, no, no, no. Um, i wanted to actually discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation about potentially increasing my salery. /nA: Oh, um, why do you ask about it at this time point? /nT: So i personally believe that i've done a lot of good things for this company, such as leading many projects, bringing lots of business to the company, and i've taken on a lot of extra work that wasn't necessarily assigned to. /nA: So you believe you deserve a raising salary ? /nT: Yes, indeed, i do. Um, in fact, i feel like you could ask anyone in the office, including upper management, about my work ethic. And i believe that i worked harder than almost anyone. /nA: First of all, i have to say i think that there are other people working really hard, but i also enjoy working with you but from the perspective of manager i have to say the raise in salary is a pretty complicated process i have to discuss with higher managements so i cannot decided at this time /nT: what aren't you the one who has the final say? i don't understand why we would why you would need thio discuss this with upper management. like i said earlier, you could ask anyone in the office including upper management about my work ethic and i think they definitely back /nA: what do you think what you are saying that you work hard you did a great job yeah, pretty much agree with that but did a good job not equal to raising your salary like i said, salary is a pretty complicated thing, and not only for you working hard and also related to the conditions of our company you. know what I’m saying? /nT: i understand i understand and i definitely i respect that, but i just think that i'm asking to just think about raising the salary considering that i've been working here for three years, i've never had any problems i've won numerous employee of the month awards as well as earning the highest productivity rate in the office last year and considering that i have filled in for higher management numerous times, i believe that the current salary i have doesn't reflect accurately what i'm capable of doing, /nA: yeah, but like i said, the prospective employees and employer are different. But i believe that you did a great job. But i have to say that our company has a really promising future. We're going to develop a lot of other business. So i believe you have a great future working here. But when it comes to salary, even if i discussed with someone else, some other, managers in our company, and it might still take a pretty long time to make a final decision, do you think that is acceptable to you ?/nT: Can you can you explain a little bit more ? /nA: Yeah, i mean, even if i decided to okay, we began the discussion to give you a higher salary. It might take, like, a year or few months to make a final decision. Do you think that will work for you? Is it urgent /nT: I would definitely wouldn't say it's very urgent, but i would i would appreciate if we could just get get it into the talks and just thinking about, like, raising my salary, considering i've been working for the past three years, maybe, like, on my fourth year of working, i would expect, not expect, but i would appreciate ah, higher raise a raise. Um, but i do understand that is a long process. /nA: Yeah, uh, great, you can understand that, and i think there's. One more thing to discuss. If you cannot get a higher salary in this year, do you consider a change of company ? /nT: No, because i definitely think, considering the way how open you are, of discussing the possibility of a raise that i could come back next year or the year after that. And try to, you know, discuss the higher salary when the future, when the company is going to be doing much better. And when i will be more much more experienced than too /nA: yeah, sounds good. /nT: Cool. Thanks.","A: Hi/nT: Hi/nA: How are you doing? So what brings you into the office today?/nT: i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to open a conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: So you need to justify to me why you deserve a raise./nT: I have done a lot of good things for the company, I’ve led many projects running a lot of business for the company, and i've taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me./nA: Ok, so, to be honest with you, I’m just one level higher than you, so I don’t have the authority to make the final decision, and I think the first step is, you know in the company we have standard procedure, so you probably should go into the system and apply for it. The application for a raise or a promotion/nT: Oh, i can show them all the work. I think. You know, for the past couple of months.  I think they would Be very impressed. /nA: I think you do have the potential for a raise. As I said, I don’t have the final decision, all I can do for you is just, I can talk to my supervisor about the situation/nT: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate that. When do you think you could do that? Y/nA: Also, I would like to know if you have been receiving any other offers from other companies recently/nT: I’m sorry, excuse me?/nA: Have you received any offers from other companies, are you interested in a move/nT: I see for searching for jobs, or/nA: Yeah, currently you are not satisfied with your salary, are you interested in a move?/nT: Yeah, i guess the thing is that i really i want to stay here working for the company, because i put a lot of dedication and time into this community, because it's something i'm passionate about. I’m really passionate about my work, and that’s been shown through the numerous employee of  the month of awards i received, um, you know, i earned the highest productivity rate in the office. And so it's. Not so much a problem with me being unhappy with job. It's the fact that i have been so much into it. But i don't feel that that's reflective with the work that i'm putting in salary receipt. /nA: Ok, so could you just give an estimation of the number, like ten percent raise, fifteen percent raise?/nT: Yes, because i've been working for the past three years. You know, i would say that we could compromise with about fifteen percent raise.  /nA: first thing, you should. Definitely you should apply in the system then the supervisor will see your situation, your status, and second, I can talk to the supervisor in coming weeks. And another thing is that our company is going to have are you willing to do that?/nT: What would that be in addition to what i'm currently doing/nA:  yeah. That would be in addition Probably you can have a conversation on that /nT: I see. So maybe, if we get the salary taking care of, and then see where that goes. And then if that gets approved then. Maybe i could take that on for either increase salary. Or possibly a bonus or something /nA: Ok got you, I’ll see what I can do for you/nT: Okay, sounds great. So i'll fill out the application for the salary increases. Then we'll get that on. Then talk about the advertising project you talked about that's. sounds Interesting, ","A: Yeah come on in. What do you want to talk with me today? /nT: Uh yes i actually wanted to discuss something important with you regarding my future and present in the company and i was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary/nA:  So you want to increase your salary? Why do you think you deserve a raise ? /nT: Um well because i believe that i have done a lot of helpful things for the company and for my team i have led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that wasn't necessarily a part of my role but i took the initiative to go above and beyond and i've even filled in for higher management numerous times which has given me a lot of exposure and something that's higher than my job /nA: okay, so all right say would what do you think you can contribute to our company in the future? /nT: I think that my past record speaks for the future as well i'm a hard worker i'm driven and my passion for my my passion for my career also has to do with the company if the company does better i know that i will benefit from it as well so i always strive to do things that will help better my team, my company and my career as a whole /nA: Sounds like you’ve done a lot of jobs, but i think your colleagues have done the same things as you did so probably you can give me some other reasons like why you deserve a raise yeah you need to convince me /nT: well i'm not sure what the other employees have done and i can't speak on their behalf i can show you that what i've been working on and that's a two fold answer one is in the numbers and you can see that i've won numerous employee of the month awards i've earned the highest productivity rate in the office for last year and like i said earlier have i filled in for higher management numerous times whatever it's needed and that's more of the numbers part of it and stuff that you can see right away the more qualitative to part of that is that i believe that the people i work with whether it be my direct managers whether it be people below me or whether it be my co workers can really see the passion in time and effort i've put into this company and to really have a raise would incentivize me to do even better and to grow even more and be more successful along what making the company more successful aswell/nA:  it sounds reasonable but like i say what if like from what i know i think probably we don't have enough budget for you know give you a raise. I know that you do a lot of contribution to come, but probably we can’t give you a raise because probably we don't have enough budget, but probably we can give you several days off instead of give you budget, what do you think about that? /nT: Um, of course, anything would be appreciated since, like i said, i would love to have a little bit of, uh, incentive for all the work that i do put it to this company. And if you do happen to have some leeway a little bit of leeway with the budget, i promise you that what you i will be an investment to the company. What you end up spending on me ? I will work as hard as I can. Like i said, earlier numbers and inequality to earn back twice, three times four times as much for the company itself through my contracts. /nA: So i know i'm cannot make a decision on your request. I just your contact with the upper management to talk about your  request and would you want to talk with them? /nT: Yeah, i would love to talk to that. I can show them all the work that i've been doing these past couple of months. And hopefully i believe they would be very impressed. /nA: Ok sure/nT: Thank you so much, thanks.","A: Hello, come in. /nT: Hello, was wondering if you had a moment to talk. /nA: Yeah, sure, what do you want to talk ?/nT:  Well, i was wondering if we could discuss my current status in the company i was, hoping to potentially discuss on increased my salary. /nA: So why do you want to ask for the raise? /nT: Well, i had been thinking about it. I was thinking about my role and position and involvement in the company, uh, was thinking about the work and the business that have provided in the past when the work that i continue to do today, um, i think that these things no. In my mind, are deserving of an increase in salary. /nA: So I can’t just gave you rise because you think you deserve that. You need to convince me that you do have the ability, and you do have to do some extra your job. /nT:  Of course i understand. Well, i think that the multiple projects that i've been involved with, uh, all of which have been successful. I've been working here for three years. I think that that shows the level of dedication that i'm willing to give to this position and how much i care about this, uh, this company on my job, on the success that we've created together. And i personally would like to have a greater part in that. And i think that as i increase my involvement and as i, i dedicate myself more that  calls for an increase to salary. /nA: Sounds good. Just let me ask you another question. What would you think he will bring to our company in future in the future ? Yeah, this is this what you did before. /nT: Yeah, right. Well, i like to think that that my passport, a good indicator for how i worked today and how i will choose to work tomorrow. And i think that if my level of commitment was at a certain level, as i increase that level of commitment, i think i would like to see compensation without moving forward. And i also recognize that's Not the only reason that i do this job, and i'm committed to of the position. Regardless, my pay. But, um, i think as a as I look to move forward in the company and further my professional goals, i think that this is a step i need to take. /nA: Yeah, so. I want to ask you  another question. So what if i give you a chance to do some low because you have you already been here for three years ? If i give you some lower level work, would you prefer to do that ? Would you willing to do that ? /nT: Uh, you know well, i think, um, i would be willing to take on additional work loads, of course, to prove my my dedication and commitment, i i'd certainly be willing to showcase my work ethic.And you know, to not just, uh, ask for a raise blindly, but to truly show that, yeah, you, too, to show it to indicate that that this is, that i'm a worthwhile investment. /nA: So but i still need to say that i don't have the authority to give you the raise I need to contact with the upper management to, you know, to discuss if we can, give you a raise or not/nT:  Yeah, well, like i completely understand. Also, thank you for taking the time to talk to me about this.","Go no prison. /nT: Hey, how’s it going?/nA: Good, so what did you want to see me about?/nT: I was hoping to have an open conversation about, potentially having an increase in my salary. What ? /nA: You know in our company we have, like a standard procedure, so if you want to have an increase in your salary or get a promotion you can go to system and apply for apply for applications have you heard of it? /nT: I have not done that yet. I was hoping to approach you directly, to potentially expedite the  process or increase my chances of getting the pay raise./nA:  Could you explain some details about why we should consider you for a raise about your performance and your work ethic in the last three months /nT: so i've won several employees of the month awards I moved out to china, of my own accord, to try to, increase my position in this company and to show how dedicated I am to the company. I have earned the highest productivity rate in this past year, and i have filled in for higher management numerous times. Based on my current salary and my current job requirements. I believe i've exceeded them, therefore should compensated more for my work. /nA: Yeah, so. Imagine we are increasing your compensation, could you please give me a number a rate, like ten percent, what is the desired level /nT: Ideally, i would have fifteen percent, pay increase. That is what I am looking for. /nA: So have you been receiving any offers from any companies recently. /nT: Um, at the moment, i have not been I have not been looking for other offers. As i would still like to work for this company /nA: So you want to stay with this company? So as I can tell you, you have spent like three years in our group and your performance is way above the average. So I do think you have potential for a raise, I recommend first that you go to the system and apply for a raise application and secondly, I want to talk about, so you just came to my office and talked about a raise, but what are you expecting, like You want me to pull some strings for you or just wanted me to refer you, because I am just one level higher So to be honest with you, i don't have the right to say. I don't have the final decision for the salary, all I can do is to refer to my supervisor. I can show him your Performance education. /nT: Um, okay, i could go fill out the application in the system. I understand your position only being one step about mine i do appreciate you recognizing the value i put into this company? If if you can, if you have the time and are willing, if you could refer me to your supervisors, i would really appreciate that. /nA: Yeah, i just wanted to say, i am not the final person to make the decision and another thing that is interesting our Committee is going to have extra advertising assignments in like two weeks, so, no, we're going to do low level steps to assign in our company advertising workers So is it's, not the job, you guys, should do but are you willing to spend like two or three days to help us in this advertising. /nT: I would be willing, to, help out in that in that exercise. /nA: Yeah, i should willing this extra work doesn’t give you compensation. That you are willing to do that for/nT: I understand I am not provided compensation. However, i am still dedicated this company. I want to see the company succeed i would like to succeed in the company. i want to do whatever i can to help this company./nA:  Just just to be clear, you are not interested in a move, you know, looking for any offers /nT: at this moment, no, however, I do understand my own value, and if the company does not recognize that in the near future, then i might potentially move but at the moment, i'm not. I would like to stay at the company /nA: So I can promise you that I will refer to my supervisors this week and get back to you and you should definitely apply in the system. /nT: okay, that will work","A: Okay hello come in why don't you want to meet with today's problem is there a problem with your work?/nT: no sir actually just wanted to discuss something with you i was hoping to have a conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary./nA: oh sure i opened his question could you give any further reasons?/nT: Right, so I’ve done a lot of good things for the company i've led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company and i've taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me/nA: i've seen your work ethic you bring to the company and i think there will be a potential for you to receive a raise but first of all i have to, i want to see what upper management says well, i think we have a standard process for the pay raise so why do you want to talk with me personally?/nT:  so i thought that you would be the one who was eventually in charge of this but i could definitely go back to the upper management and show them the work i've been doing the past couple of months and i think that they would be impressed /nA: okay so actually i don't i don't have authority to make a final decision but maybe my recommendation can also help help you about that but i cannot guarantee that you will get a pay raise immediately. also maybe before you get a pay raise, there will be maybe some evaluation process during that time you have to maybe you will be asked to go out of the office or distribute some flyers. Would you like to do that?/nT: All right. I would be definitely willing to do that. I would love to go through the entire process if there's a formal process for doing this./nA:  and one thing i want to make it clear that even if i support in the upper management it's. Not definitely that you get a pay raise. What if your request is not approved, /nT: so i guess that is up to them. In the end, i would understand that if they go through the process and evaluate me and they do not think that i deserve that that's understandable. /nA: Yeah, but you haven't got a pay raise in about two or three years. Would you complain to them about that?/nT; Um, i think i would go to them and pitch Why, i think i do deserve this pay raise, and I personally believe that i do, and so i wouldn’t completely understand it. But in the end, it is their decision, /nA:  And i mean that's, even if your request is approved. It takes about two or three months to take effect. During that time i hope you can still walk hard as before. And to contribute to our company and by the way, person question i did do you receive any offers from other companies? /nT: Um, i'm not actively looking for other companies, and i'm very committed to the company. And so i don't think that whether or not i get a pay raise will affect my level of work. /nA: Okay, so i mean you, if your request for a pay raise, is not approved, will you consider searching for jobs at other companies? /nT: Well, i have been very committed to the company. Obviously, i've been here for the past few years. Three years yes, and i would love to be able to stay with company. So primarily i would try to do that. /nA: Okay, thanks for honesty and thanks for the information. Maybe I will talk with my upper manager tomorrow morning and give any feedback from that maybe to help you, to Get better Prepared for evaluation in the future. If anything else, /nT: no, thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me. And i will make sure to go through the process or the potential pay raise","A: Hi/nT: Hi/nA: How are you doing?

And i know you to be somebody who's going to reward hard work. I think that i'm served this company well. And i think that at this point, i just i'm really looking for maybe higher wage or something to let it be recognized that I have been working hard. /nA:  You are not satisfied with your current compensation?/nT: I just think that with some of the accolades that I have received in this past year, maybe it's, just time for me, move a little bit higher in the ranks, /nA: What amount of salary increase would you like?/nT: I think that I’ll leave that up to you. I think that you've been a good boss to me. And i have no reason to doubt that you would give me anything less than what you feel is appropriate. /nA: Have you been considering offers from other companies? /nT: i usually like to remain pretty loyal. And so i think that before i would go exploring other options, i would come to you. First. You say that i want to continue working for you, but I need a little change. That’s where I stand/nA: So in our company, we have a standard procedure for getting a raise, have you applied in the system?/nT: i looked into it, but i think that something that i've always been told is you want something, you should go straight to the person and talk to them. /nA: So you want me to pull some strings for you? I don’t have the full authority to do anything./nT:  That makes total sense and that's, definitely something that i'm interested in and having you do it's, just maybe about you coming one level higher. I think that it’s definitely valued. And i think that me filling out an official form will not go as far. You actually going one level higher up and just talking for me personally. /nA: I think you should file the application, the company will have an extra exercise in advertising in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come in and do an activity with no compensation? /nT: That's a good question. Two days, with no conversation at all. /nA: Yeah/nT:. Yes, i think that if you give me your word that you're going to, try to do all that. I could definitely see myself doing this is taking on a little more responsibility. /nA: I will talk to my supervisor and let you know. ","Introduction: /nA: Hello, come in what is the problem?/nT: No problem, sir. I just came here to say I wanted to talk to you about potentially getting a pay raise. While i'm really grateful for being able to work here for the past three years and an excellent boss. I think that i've displayed a lot of leadership, good work ethic, doing things haven't really been assigned to me, and i think that based on those. I could really use a pay raise. /nA: We have a system, why did you come to me?/nT: Well, i just considered. Since you're the boss, you would know you the authority to give me a pay raise. /nA: I don’t make the final decision, I have to ask my upper management. /nT: Then, in that case, do you think you could speak to him on my approval on my behalf? /nA: Sure, I have worked with you for three years and you have a strong work ethic, so I will support you in my recommendation, but since I do not have the authority to make the decision, I cannot guarantee you will get the pay raise/nT: Okay, who else would i be competing with? /nA: You will have competitors from other departments, it depends on the results of the overall evaluation./nT: Do you think i would be competitive for pay raise? You said yourself that, you know, i worked really hard with your, you know, recommendation. I think that would go a long way with upper management. /nA: From my point of view, you are competitive. One thing I want to make clear is that it may take two or three months for the pay raise to take effect. I hope you will still work hard during that time/nT: Okay./nA: If your request is not approved, what will you do?/nT: No, you think, you know, if it's not approved i would just come back and ask why, but I don't want to infringe on your job, because you know you're more connected, to upper management than i am, but i'd still, like to pursue that as much as possible. /nA: Okay, i'll talk to my manager tomorrow and, give you feedback tomorrow. I hope you will get better results. Would you like to do other work?/nT: Right now or once i get a pay rise/nA:  Before the decision./nT: I don’t see why not./nA: I will propose this and talk to you when I get feedback./nA: Thank you, sir.

So primarily i would try to do that. /nA: Okay, thanks for honesty and thanks for the information. Maybe I will talk with my upper manager tomorrow morning and give any feedback from that maybe to help you, to Get better Prepared for evaluation in the future. If anything else, /nT: no, thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me. And i will make sure to go through the process or the potential pay raise","A: Hi, come in. How are you?/nT: I’m good./nA: What do you want to talk about with me?/nT: I want to talk about how I have been overlooked in this company. I believe I have been mistreated and deserve a raise. /nA: Okay, so you want a raise. Why do you feel you deserve that?/nT: I've done a lot of things for the company. I’ve lead many projects brought in a lot of business for the company, have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: I think probably other colleges have done that same work that you did. So that is not necessarily a good enough reason. /nT: I can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple months. I believe they will be very impressed. /nA: You need to convince me more. /nT: I believe I have gone above and beyond in my role as an employee here and a lot of people can attest to that and i think i brought a lot of success to the company, which is why i deserve a raise after three years./nA; What can you contribute to company in the future /nT: in the future, with the higher managerial role, i will be able to further the success by controlling more employees, more divisions of the company, and hopefully bring better outlook for the future. /nA: Uh, From what i know, i probably don't have enough budget to give you a raise. /nT: When you recreate the budget for next year, I would appreciate if you could keep my thoughts in mind. /nA: What if I give you some extra work, would you be willing to do that, even if it is lower level?/nT: I would be willing to do that, but i already go above and beyond my duties and do a lot more work than I am required to do. /nA: I can promise you that I can give you a raise because I cannot make decisions on raises. /nT: Yeah, i could contact them, but i prefer it if you could also put in your word based on my work. /nT: I am not the one who makes the decision, so you probably need to convince them that you are very good at your position.","A: Hello, come in. /nT: Hello, was wondering if you had a moment to talk. /nA: Yeah, sure, what do you want to talk ?/nT:  Well, i was wondering if we could discuss my current status in the company i was, hoping to potentially discuss on increased my salary. /nA: So why do you want to ask for the raise? /nT: Well, i had been thinking about it. I was thinking about my role and position and involvement in the company, uh, was thinking about the work and the business that have provided in the past when the work that i continue to do today, um, i think that these things no. In my mind, are deserving of an increase in salary. /nA: So I can’t just gave you rise because you think you deserve that. You need to convince me that you do have the ability, and you do have to do some extra your job. /nT:  Of course i understand. Well, i think that the multiple projects that i've been involved with, uh, all of which have been successful. I've been working here for three years. I think that that shows the level of dedication that i'm willing to give to this position and how much i care about this, uh, this company on my job, on the success that we've created together. And i personally would like to have a greater part in that. And i think that as i increase my involvement and as i, i dedicate myself more that  calls for an increase to salary. /nA: Sounds good. Just let me ask you another question. What would you think he will bring to our company in future in the future ? Yeah, this is this what you did before. /nT: Yeah, right. Well, i like to think that that my passport, a good indicator for how i worked today and how i will choose to work tomorrow. And i think that if my level of commitment was at a certain level, as i increase that level of commitment, i think i would like to see compensation without moving forward. And i also recognize that's Not the only reason that i do this job, and i'm committed to of the position. Regardless, my pay. But, um, i think as a as I look to move forward in the company and further my professional goals, i think that this is a step i need to take. /nA: Yeah, so. I want to ask you  another question. So what if i give you a chance to do some low because you have you already been here for three years ? If i give you some lower level work, would you prefer to do that ? Would you willing to do that ? /nT: Uh, you know well, i think, um, i would be willing to take on additional work loads, of course, to prove my my dedication and commitment, i i'd certainly be willing to showcase my work ethic.And you know, to not just, uh, ask for a raise blindly, but to truly show that, yeah, you, too, to show it to indicate that that this is, that i'm a worthwhile investment. /nA: So but i still need to say that i don't have the authority to give you the raise I need to contact with the upper management to, you know, to discuss if we can, give you a raise or not/nT:  Yeah, well, like i completely understand. Also, thank you for taking the time to talk to me about this.","Introduction: /nA: Hello, come in what is the problem?/nT: No problem, sir. I just came here to say I wanted to talk to you about potentially getting a pay raise. While i'm really grateful for being able to work here for the past three years and an excellent boss. I think that i've displayed a lot of leadership, good work ethic, doing things haven't really been assigned to me, and i think that based on those. I could really use a pay raise. /nA: We have a system, why did you come to me?/nT: Well, i just considered. Since you're the boss, you would know you the authority to give me a pay raise. /nA: I don’t make the final decision, I have to ask my upper management. /nT: Then, in that case, do you think you could speak to him on my approval on my behalf? /nA: Sure, I have worked with you for three years and you have a strong work ethic, so I will support you in my recommendation, but since I do not have the authority to make the decision, I cannot guarantee you will get the pay raise/nT: Okay, who else would i be competing with? /nA: You will have competitors from other departments, it depends on the results of the overall evaluation./nT: Do you think i would be competitive for pay raise? You said yourself that, you know, i worked really hard with your, you know, recommendation. I think that would go a long way with upper management. /nA: From my point of view, you are competitive. One thing I want to make clear is that it may take two or three months for the pay raise to take effect. I hope you will still work hard during that time/nT: Okay./nA: If your request is not approved, what will you do?/nT: No, you think, you know, if it's not approved i would just come back and ask why, but I don't want to infringe on your job, because you know you're more connected, to upper management than i am, but i'd still, like to pursue that as much as possible. /nA: Okay, i'll talk to my manager tomorrow and, give you feedback tomorrow. I hope you will get better results. Would you like to do other work?/nT: Right now or once i get a pay rise/nA:  Before the decision./nT: I don’t see why not./nA: I will propose this and talk to you when I get feedback./nA: Thank you, sir. That no, mr, thank you.","A: Good morning./nT: good morning, /nA: what do you want to talk about? /nT: nothing much, sir. Um, i just think i want to talk to you about just discuss something really simple. I want to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Why should we increase your salary?/nT: Yes, of course. You know, i've been working closely with you for the past three years since i moved over here and were able to give this amazing opportunity for me to grow and develop my career, which i would like to thank you so much. And not only work but also lead many other projects, i'm bring a lot of business for the company and do really well with it, and I’ve also taken up a lot of extra work that was necessary assigned to me just so that i can do what's best for out company./nA: We have a standard procedure, to apply for a raise. Why did you not apply for a raise in the system? /nT: like you said, you can ask almost anyone in the office, I am always working very hard and for those reasons. I have applied for the raise but they've never been completely approved. And that's. Why i want to talk to you specifically, obviously because I’ve worked so closely with you and you have seen me grow over the years, to see what could be the reasons for that. /nA: I’m your direct supervisor, and you have not received a response. You are very productive, and you have been very dedicated. Have you received offers from other companies?/nT: Oh, i mean, specifically from our company. Got in. I'm employed a month over and over again. So that kind of awards from us to see that i have been getting good work done and expanding our business to other places. /nA: Have you considered moving to another company. /nT: For me, when i obviously when I moved to china and coming to work at this office, my goal was getting kind of continue on with our company. I wasn't planning on jumping for one company to another, and i wanted to stick with us. And help grow myself and my career, as well as use that help our company grow to be the best that it could be/nA:  How much do you want for the raise?/nT: I think that i've been working for three, full years now and have gone above and beyond, so i was hoping that i would be able to get a fifteen to twenty percent raise. /nA: There is an opportunity to do advertising work next week, would you take extra work?/nT: Yeah, of course, i would be ready to kind of do anything that cos obviously, like expertise, people and other things that could help bring more. All represented, kind of like being in a panel showing how it's been such a great experience working here how much I have learned from it. But again, i would do pretty much anything that there needs to be done in order to help our company out and let it grow /nT: Do you want me to pull strings? Why do you want my help?/nA: I think that obviously, just since we've been working together and that you are my boss for the past three years, i think people also very professional are also very good personal relationship, that we're good friends, and that i always look up to you and see you as someone who is a great leader and someone who can always help me out in any case. So with that, i was hoping that you would be able to put a referral or just kind of help out in the process, simply because i know you've seen me work. You've seen what my value is for the company and also since we have such a great relationship, I thought it would be a good idea to speak to you./nA: I don’t have the ability to approve the raise, but I can refer you to the supervisors and get back to you./nT: yes, of course, like I tried to go through the normal channels, as well and everything, and i was hoping that even though you're just one level above me, we've seen that you obviously to do so much for the company, you have your own influence and things like that, and since obviously again, it's up to you. But as you've seen me work kind of with you over the past few years, i just thought that you could also continue to fight expedite the process, because, obviously, like all the rest of the process is important. I feel like i've kind of been through that kind of led me astray to nowhere, so that you could kind of just, like, help me out. ","A: hello, come in, why did you want to meet with me today? Are there any problems with your work. /nT: No there's, no problem. I just wanted to talk about the idea, potentially me getting a raise. /nA: Okay, why do you think you deserve a raise. /nT: Sure. Um, so i've been here for three years. I've been doing not only my own work, but i've been do, like more work than has been assigned to me, and i feel that it's all been very, very well done. You always really appreciated everything. And so i was just thinking that after a long time and for the value that i bring, i think that a pay raise is appropriate at this time. /nA: Did you apply in our system for a raise?/nT: i didn't do it yet, but i can write that letter if that's what's needed /nA: You may have to submit an application in the system and they will give you feedback. I have to talk to upper management before a raise can be given. /nT: Like, maybe. Can you write a recommendation ? /nA: I will meet with the upper manager, and give him a recommendation. The process may take some time. It could take months. There is a chance that the request will not be approved. What will you do if it is not approved?/nT: Um, well, after so many years, i feel that i request that this point is usually normal to happen, so it doesn't happen. Then i might want t,. I don't know. I was my direct manager that i was hoping that you'd be able to have a little more influence and maybe trying to accomplish that raise after such a long time of being here, /nA: I want to support you in getting a pay raise because I have good work experience with you, but I am not in change of the final decision. Have you received offers from other companies? /nT:  Um, recently or no, i'm not looking elsewhere right now. I would like to stay this company, and, um, i really would like the pay raise in order to be able to do that. /nA: I will talk to my upper management first and give you feedback as soon as possible. /nT: Sounds good. ","A: Hello, what brings you to my office?/nT: hi sir. I actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: You are not satisfied with your salary./nT: I feel as though i've done a lot for the company. I've led many projects and brought in a lot of business. Have a lot of work that was not assigned to me /nA: You think you deserve a higher salary?/nT: I feel as though the amount of work that i've taken on isn't reflective of my current salary./nA: What amount of salary increase do you desire?/nT: i believe i should get a fifteen percent. /nA: We have a standard procedure for getting a promotion, have you used the system?/nT: I have not done that. /nA: Why did you want to talk to me, do you want me to pull strings for you? /nT: my apology I was not aware of that there was another way to do this. /nA: I think you have potential to get a raise, I think you should apply in our system for a raise. I can talk to the supervisor about your situation. Are you considering offers from other companies. /nT: No/nA: You are not considering other offers, so you have loyalty to our company, we are going to do extra work in advertising, will you be willing to help out. /nT: I would be willing to help out the company. /nA: We need extra people, there will be no compensation. /nT: I understand. /nA: We can go through the standard procedure, we can’t have a final decision today. /nT: Thank you, I appreciate the help, Is there anything i can do to improve my case with the supervisor?/n A: Be carful with your materials in the application. /nT: Thank you for the help. I will complete the application. ","A: Come on in, what do you want to talk to me about today?/nT:  i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Why do you think that you should receive a raise?/nT: done a lot of good things for this company. I have led many projects, brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: It seems that you have done some of the same things that your colleges have been doing, so why do you specifically need to get a raise?/nT: I can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple of months. I believe that they re very impressed. /nA: Okay, so you need to give me some details and convince me that you're really good at your work. /nT: I take i worked the extra hours i have taken on roles that weren't necessarily assigned to me. I have tried my gone out of my way to learn the upper management's job and like to see if i can. I guess kind of like emulate. Um, even if i could, like, learn how to do and they believe that i would be like a great fit for the role. I think i could have gone above and beyond in the past. Um, and i believe that, like, i would be a strong candidate for an upper level job or even a higher salary because i have shown the work and, like, i had to have the work ethic in the productivity for it. /nA: We have a system for people to request raises, why did you come to see me?/nT: I think that any interaction is better face to face and thought that we could talk about, um, if i could get a raise. And if not, then like, what i can do to improve in the workplace. And then, like, i just wanted some, like, um, like. Constructive feedback from you /nA: Our company does not have enough budget for a raise, but what if we give a few more days off or something. /nT: i mean i like know that you’re the person with the final say on if someone gets a raise or not/nA: I’m not, but I can give the higher-level people suggestions and input. /nT:  so as like a lower level worker here i've seen a lot of resources that have gone to waste on how we can better fix our budget if i work with you closely on how we can fix our budget do you think then you will be able to find space in the budget to increase my salary /nA: What can you do to contribute to the company’s future. /nT: i would like some upward mobility in this company and as a higher level management worker i think i would be a great leader i have strong speaking skills people always respect me and my work ethic i i always show up i rarely ever take a day off and i will always be there for this company rain or shine. /nA: You made a lot of contributions to the company, I will be in contact with upper management to see what we can do with your request. /nT: Thank you.","A: Hi how’s it going?/nT: Doing well. /nA: What did you want to talk about? It sounds import./nT: I’m not doing too well actually, we're behind on our group project and i think you're the cause of it. /nA: I don’t understand. /nT: i'm fine. I was hoping to talk about our group project with you. There is some problems we need a fix right now. /nA: What kind of problem? /nT: The group and i feel like we have a lot of work to shoulder, and we're hoping that you'd be able to take on some more work. /nA: I am graduating, so I am really busy recently. /nT: i know you're probably really busy preparing for graduation, but it be great if you could accomplish some tasks being a senior, your expertise and, like your knowledge, were go really long way in helping us finish this project/nA: It would be going if you took more of a leadership role, maybe you could be the leader. /nT: But we felt like you haven't put a lot into this project and we will we won't be able to finish his project if you don't get this work done i think we won't be able to graduate if we don't pass this project so i think we need a little more help from your end /nA: What kind of help? Time is a limitation for me but maybe i can i gave you some other kind of help /nT: so maybe just like when we have like some questions and you keep missing some of our group meeting so just trying to attend the group meetings or like responding to some of our messages would really help us see where you're at and what t we can ask you for help and if you could help us back /nA: Attending every meeting will be pretty hard, because I am pretty busy. Maybe I can replay to emails. /nT: yeah so we notice you're really busy but we want have a chance to be able to work on the project we think you have some like great insight and a lot of stuff on what we're doing so it's been really hard tio keep up with the project because the full team hasn't been here /nA: do you think it's necessary for four people to be here at the same time to finish the project /nT: i think if we have like four people then like we can have more brains attacking like some problems because being like a sophomore like i don't have much knowledge as you might have to input on the project and show us like the proper direction to go for this project/nA: yeah yeah got you at this point but uh to solve this problem i have to say that i cannot be here every time maybe we can have some other kind of solution right maybe call me and we could use skye to attend the meeting when i am not at school do you think that is okay./nT: yeah i think like calling in or like via skype just your presence being at the meeting i think we really helped us with that if we have any issue that you might be able to help us like fix that you're right you're like nearby and easy to contact so that we can continue working on this project and that you have like a little input throughout the meetings/nA: Maybe I can give you some guidance and review your work, but I may not have time to review every detail of the work. /nT: Yeah so i think that's good, but i think still, i think you need to put in like, a little effort, because this is like a group project so just like putting in a little time, like we all know you're busy. And a lot of us are too just taking a little time out of your day to work on this project would really help us move along in the project./nA:You can take other responsibilities and you can be the leader. /nT:  Yeah, i think that's a pretty good idea. So i can just, like, check in with you to make sure that, like you, like, you're still technically the leader because the professor assigned you to be the leader so like checking up with you. That, like, what we're doing, is looking in the right direction and that. Like, i'm not taking the group in the wrong direction, making sure that you're also staying involved. So i think assigning me the leader role is okay. But i still think you should. be making the final decisions, because at the end of the day, you're the leader. I'm just the one that you gave some of the work to/nA: Okay I think that will work.","A: Why did you want to talk today?/nT: Yeah, i just wanted to see how you were doing, and while  i ran into you. I just want to talk about our group project. Have you been giving any thought at all? /nA: I’ve been pretty busy because I am graduating this summer. /nT: Yeah, so i think we're doing okay. But a lot of us are taking on a lot more work than we can kind of handle. We know that you're very busy, but we were just maybe, if we could all meet up again and maybe talk about dividing the tasks up just to keep each other accountable, and i don't mind shoulder a little bit of extra work. But i think because you're able to come to the meetings, maybe at least trying to do some work and kind of stay engaged in the meetings/nA: I may not be able to show up every time we meet, but you could assign tasks to me online and I could work on them. I could also contribute notes. /nT: that was great. Great. You could contribute those notes that there may be a little bit about outside research. And then i think just your general contributions, like in our meetings, would be really helpful. /nA: I cannot do the fundamental work like coding or outside research. /nT: That would be helpful. I think just something that kind of balance the workload would be nice, just a little bit more. /nA: How do you want to split the work?/nT: i mean, since there's four of us. I mean, it would Be nice if we could do like a twenty five percent split all the way. /nA: You can write down tasks that I can do and we can schedule a meeting with our advisor, so I could be the link between the group and the advisor. /nT: Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that's a good connection, that sounds good, so we'll just make sure we have very clear tasks. And then if you can't make a meeting that's fine, but we can move forward from there. ","A: Hello, come in. Why do you want to talk with me today? Is there a problem?/nT: no sir actually I wanted to discuss something with you i was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary/nA: Why do you feel you deserve a raise?/nT: over the past three years i felt like i've kind of gotten stock a little bit in the company despite i mean i've won a couple employee of the month awards had the highest productivity rate in the office last year and i filled in for higher management numerous times i really feel like i deserve this raise /nA: yeah i have seen your work and ever since you entered the outcome you have the perfect job in your position. Everyone in our company has a chance to get a raise. I will have to check with the upper management because I do not have the authority to make the final decision. I cannot give you a raise just because you think you deserve one. It depends on others’ evaluations./nT: I understand that, sir. In your opinion, is there anything that i could work on to improve my standing any more and potentially help help me get over the hump /nA: Maybe you can have a talk with upper management, but I will talk to them first to see what their feedback is. One thing I want to make clear is that even if your request is approved, it may take several months to get the raise. /nT: I totally get it. I mean, i enjoy working here, so i'm not going to be leaving. /nA: I’m glad that's you are happy to work here. Do you have any plans to move to another company?/nT:  that's a tough question, because it has been three years, and i'm definitely going to keep working my best. I always do. Um, if i feel like, you know, maybe it's not going to be right away, but in, like, a year or two, in a couple of years, you know how it is. If i feel like i can earn a little bit of a bump up in pay somewhere else, i might have to take that opportunity. I've got a family, you understand how that is? /nA: Yeah, i understand that, and thanks for your honesty Well, i try my best to support you in your request. I hope this will not effect your work during this time. /nT: Absolutely not.  Thank you for listening to appreciate it. ","A: Hi/nT: Thank you for meeting me, I know your time is valuable. /nA: What brings you to my office today?/nT: i just i think that i know you to be fair. And i know you to be somebody who's going to reward hard work. I think that i'm served this company well. And i think that at this point, i just i'm really looking for maybe higher wage or something to let it be recognized that I have been working hard. /nA:  You are not satisfied with your current compensation?/nT: I just think that with some of the accolades that I have received in this past year, maybe it's, just time for me, move a little bit higher in the ranks, /nA: What amount of salary increase would you like?/nT: I think that I’ll leave that up to you. I think that you've been a good boss to me. And i have no reason to doubt that you would give me anything less than what you feel is appropriate. /nA: Have you been considering offers from other companies? /nT: i usually like to remain pretty loyal. And so i think that before i would go exploring other options, i would come to you. First. You say that i want to continue working for you, but I need a little change. That’s where I stand/nA: So in our company, we have a standard procedure for getting a raise, have you applied in the system?/nT: i looked into it, but i think that something that i've always been told is you want something, you should go straight to the person and talk to them. /nA: So you want me to pull some strings for you? I don’t have the full authority to do anything./nT:  That makes total sense and that's, definitely something that i'm interested in and having you do it's, just maybe about you coming one level higher. I think that it’s definitely valued. And i think that me filling out an official form will not go as far. You actually going one level higher up and just talking for me personally. /nA: I think you should file the application, the company will have an extra exercise in advertising in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come in and do an activity with no compensation? /nT: That's a good question. Two days, with no conversation at all. /nA: Yeah/nT:. Yes, i think that if you give me your word that you're going to, try to do all that. I could definitely see myself doing this is taking on a little more responsibility. /nA: I will talk to my supervisor and let you know. ","A: Hi, what did you want to talk about? Is there a problem relating to your work?/nT: Um, not exactly. I wanted to discuss with you about my salary and position in the job./nA: Do you have a question related to your salary or position in the job?/nT: so recently have been showing a lot of. I've been helping out the company a lot uh have won a lot of employee awards I have had the highest productivity rate in the office last year and i thought i deserved maybe an increase in salary /nA: yeah i do agree that you did a great job in past few years and i also enjoyed working with you uh but i hope you understand that increase in salary is a pretty serious complicated process and i can’t decide it by myself /nT: um you would you have to go to your higher ups to discuss about it /nA: yeah and that is one aspect, there are many factors we need to think about. /nT:  is there any way i could contact your higher-ups and discuss all my achievements and accomplishments to show them that i've achieved what i believe is enough to earn a higher salary /nA: Why do you need a salary increase at this time point? /nT: i personally just believe i deserve it also coming to this job i expected expected to achieve a higher salary within after a couple of years and that hasn’t been shown yet /nA: Yeah, I can understand that, I think we're a really great company, and then we have a very promising future. I really will have a great development, the future. So if you're keeping working with us, i personally enjoyed working with you. And if you're working with us in the future, i believe you're having an increase in salary. But i have to say, this can obviously it would be such a short period of time. /nT: Can you just let me know if there's any progress in that situation? /nA: It may take a while, but I will give you updates. /nT: Ok, thank you very much. ","A: Hi, why do you want to meet with me today? Is there a problem related to your work?/nT: no ma’am i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potential increasing my salary. /nA: Um, okay, why do you ask that at this time?/nT: I have done a lot of good things in this company, i've led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company, taken on higher management roles and have taken a lot of extra work, that was not assigned to me. /nA: Okay, but i think increasing the salary is a pretty complicated and serious process. Many other colleges have worked hard. I’m still not convinced. /nT: I believe i'm the best worker you have in this company. I've been a lot of good things for you, but if you want, you can ask higher management and i can show them all the hard work I’ve done over the past few months, i think there will be really impressed. /nA: I hope you can understand this is a serious thing and we need to asses you before approving the increase. /nT: Yeah, i understand, and i think my previous work and experience can back me up on why i think I should get a higher salary. /nA: We are a very promising company with a very good future. So you're considering leaving our company if we cannot increase your salary at this time?/nT:  Well, for the past three years since i've been here, my salary has remained stagnant. So i think if i were not to get a salary increase, I may have to consider my options. /nA: Oh, yeah, okay. I think i enjoyed working with you. But even if you are considering other options I have to talk with higher management. It may take a few months to make a final decision. /nT: Okay, is there any way to reduce that time from a couple of months, to say, perhaps one or two months. /nA: I cannot decide the time frame for making the final decision. /nT: Okay, i understand on i just, if possible, could you get back to me when once upper management has made his decision about my salary increase? /nA: Yeah, there's some updates, of course, I will let you know. /nT: Thank you for your time.","A: Hello, come in. Why do you want to meet with me today? Is there a problem with your work?/nT: No, i think work is fine, it's. Kind of, actually. Well, i wanted to come talk to you. I was hoping to have a conversation about potentially increasing salary. /nA: You want a salary increase?/nT: Yeah, exactly. I feel like i've done a lot of good work for the company in the past year, especially, and having been here for three years, i've done a lot of work to lead many projects and brought a lot of good business to the company. So i felt like i've taken on a lot of extra work and I deserve the raise./nA: Our company has a standard process for applying for a raise. Why did you want to talk with me?/nT: Um, well, i felt like i can show them all the work, and i could tell them all the things that i've done. But at the end, like, aren’t you the one who will have the final say, so it's Easier to come directly to you/nA: Actually, i don't have the authority to make the final decision. I would have to report to upper management before letting you know. /nT: So the only thing i could do is submit paperwork to hr and hope that they will get back to me?/nA: You also need my approval to make the final decision. I will talk with my upper management first. /nT: could you also put in like a good word in hr with me for me so that way it's i'm covering all my bases /nA: yeah sure would like to i really appreciate your help with my work. However even if I give you a recommendation, it doesn’t necessarily mean you will get a pay raise. /nT: thank you appreciate it like hopefully like hr will see the amount of like i've done a lot of good work here have won employee of the month more than once like this past year has been like my most successful year so hopefully like with all of that being said and you hopefully putting in a good word for me and talking to the upper management maybe make it work towards a better salary /nA: Even if your request is approved it takes several months to take effect. /nT: there's nothing i can do now like you in the near future i just have to wait?/nA: You also have to continue working hard. What if your request is not approved?/nT: then i'd honestly like to request to talk to your higher up because i feel like i have proven my worth to this company and i think i can not only show that, but i can also talk about that, especially with the higher ups because i feel like i'm deserving of this /nA: You can do that. Have you received offers at other companies?/nT: Um i haven't really considered working at any other company i really like the job here. So i'm i'm honestly just banking on this salary raise because i really like the work that i do here and hopefully the work i'm doing here has been benefiting the company./nA: okay Sure, i appreciate your honesty I will talk with my upper management and give you feedback. /nT: Sounds good. Thank you","A: Hi, come in. How are you?/nT: I’m good./nA: What do you want to talk about with me?/nT: I want to talk about how I have been overlooked in this company. I believe I have been mistreated and deserve a raise. /nA: Okay, so you want a raise. Why do you feel you deserve that?/nT: I've done a lot of things for the company. I’ve lead many projects brought in a lot of business for the company, have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: I think probably other colleges have done that same work that you did. So that is not necessarily a good enough reason. /nT: I can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple months. I believe they will be very impressed. /nA: You need to convince me more. /nT: I believe I have gone above and beyond in my role as an employee here and a lot of people can attest to that and i think i brought a lot of success to the company, which is why i deserve a raise after three years./nA; What can you contribute to company in the future /nT: in the future, with the higher managerial role, i will be able to further the success by controlling more employees, more divisions of the company, and hopefully bring better outlook for the future. /nA: Uh, From what i know, i probably don't have enough budget to give you a raise. /nT: When you recreate the budget for next year, I would appreciate if you could keep my thoughts in mind. /nA: What if I give you some extra work, would you be willing to do that, even if it is lower level?/nT: I would be willing to do that, but i already go above and beyond my duties and do a lot more work than I am required to do. /nA: I can promise you that I can give you a raise because I cannot make decisions on raises. /nT: Yeah, i could contact them, but i prefer it if you could also put in your word based on my work. /nT: I am not the one who makes the decision, so you probably need to convince them that you are very good at your position.","A: hello, come in, why did you want to meet with me today? Are there any problems with your work. /nT: No there's, no problem. I just wanted to talk about the idea, potentially me getting a raise. /nA: Okay, why do you think you deserve a raise. /nT: Sure. Um, so i've been here for three years. I've been doing not only my own work, but i've been do, like more work than has been assigned to me, and i feel that it's all been very, very well done. You always really appreciated everything. And so i was just thinking that after a long time and for the value that i bring, i think that a pay raise is appropriate at this time. /nA: Did you apply in our system for a raise?/nT: i didn't do it yet, but i can write that letter if that's what's needed /nA: You may have to submit an application in the system and they will give you feedback. I have to talk to upper management before a raise can be given. /nT: Like, maybe. Can you write a recommendation ? /nA: I will meet with the upper manager, and give him a recommendation. The process may take some time. It could take months. There is a chance that the request will not be approved. What will you do if it is not approved?/nT: Um, well, after so many years, i feel that i request that this point is usually normal to happen, so it doesn't happen. Then i might want t,. I don't know. I was my direct manager that i was hoping that you'd be able to have a little more influence and maybe trying to accomplish that raise after such a long time of being here, /nA: I want to support you in getting a pay raise because I have good work experience with you, but I am not in change of the final decision. Have you received offers from other companies? /nT:  Um, recently or no, i'm not looking elsewhere right now. I would like to stay this company, and, um, i really would like the pay raise in order to be able to do that. /nA: I will talk to my upper management first and give you feedback as soon as possible. /nT: Sounds good. ","A: Hi how’s it going?/nT: Doing well. /nA: What did you want to talk about? It sounds import./nT: I’m not doing too well actually, we're behind on our group project and i think you're the cause of it. /nA: I don’t understand. /nT: i'm fine. I was hoping to talk about our group project with you. There is some problems we need a fix right now. /nA: What kind of problem? /nT: The group and i feel like we have a lot of work to shoulder, and we're hoping that you'd be able to take on some more work. /nA: I am graduating, so I am really busy recently. /nT: i know you're probably really busy preparing for graduation, but it be great if you could accomplish some tasks being a senior, your expertise and, like your knowledge, were go really long way in helping us finish this project/nA: It would be going if you took more of a leadership role, maybe you could be the leader. /nT: But we felt like you haven't put a lot into this project and we will we won't be able to finish his project if you don't get this work done i think we won't be able to graduate if we don't pass this project so i think we need a little more help from your end /nA: What kind of help? Time is a limitation for me but maybe i can i gave you some other kind of help /nT: so maybe just like when we have like some questions and you keep missing some of our group meeting so just trying to attend the group meetings or like responding to some of our messages would really help us see where you're at and what t we can ask you for help and if you could help us back /nA: Attending every meeting will be pretty hard, because I am pretty busy. Maybe I can replay to emails. /nT: yeah so we notice you're really busy but we want have a chance to be able to work on the project we think you have some like great insight and a lot of stuff on what we're doing so it's been really hard tio keep up with the project because the full team hasn't been here /nA: do you think it's necessary for four people to be here at the same time to finish the project /nT: i think if we have like four people then like we can have more brains attacking like some problems because being like a sophomore like i don't have much knowledge as you might have to input on the project and show us like the proper direction to go for this project/nA: yeah yeah got you at this point but uh to solve this problem i have to say that i cannot be here every time maybe we can have some other kind of solution right maybe call me and we could use skye to attend the meeting when i am not at school do you think that is okay./nT: yeah i think like calling in or like via skype just your presence being at the meeting i think we really helped us with that if we have any issue that you might be able to help us like fix that you're right you're like nearby and easy to contact so that we can continue working on this project and that you have like a little input throughout the meetings/nA: Maybe I can give you some guidance and review your work, but I may not have time to review every detail of the work. /nT: Yeah so i think that's good, but i think still, i think you need to put in like, a little effort, because this is like a group project so just like putting in a little time, like we all know you're busy. And a lot of us are too just taking a little time out of your day to work on this project would really help us move along in the project./nA:You can take other responsibilities and you can be the leader. /nT:  Yeah, i think that's a pretty good idea. So i can just, like, check in with you to make sure that, like you, like, you're still technically the leader because the professor assigned you to be the leader so like checking up with you. That, like, what we're doing, is looking in the right direction and that. Like, i'm not taking the group in the wrong direction, making sure that you're also staying involved. So i think assigning me the leader role is okay. But i still think you should. be making the final decisions, because at the end of the day, you're the leader. I'm just the one that you gave some of the work to/nA: Okay I think that will work.","A: Hi, why do you want to meet with me today? Is there a problem related to your work?/nT: no ma’am i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potential increasing my salary. /nA: Um, okay, why do you ask that at this time?/nT: I have done a lot of good things in this company, i've led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company, taken on higher management roles and have taken a lot of extra work, that was not assigned to me. /nA: Okay, but i think increasing the salary is a pretty complicated and serious process. Many other colleges have worked hard. I’m still not convinced. /nT: I believe i'm the best worker you have in this company. I've been a lot of good things for you, but if you want, you can ask higher management and i can show them all the hard work I’ve done over the past few months, i think there will be really impressed. /nA: I hope you can understand this is a serious thing and we need to asses you before approving the increase. /nT: Yeah, i understand, and i think my previous work and experience can back me up on why i think I should get a higher salary. /nA: We are a very promising company with a very good future. So you're considering leaving our company if we cannot increase your salary at this time?/nT:  Well, for the past three years since i've been here, my salary has remained stagnant. So i think if i were not to get a salary increase, I may have to consider my options. /nA: Oh, yeah, okay. I think i enjoyed working with you. But even if you are considering other options I have to talk with higher management. It may take a few months to make a final decision. /nT: Okay, is there any way to reduce that time from a couple of months, to say, perhaps one or two months. /nA: I cannot decide the time frame for making the final decision. /nT: Okay, i understand on i just, if possible, could you get back to me when once upper management has made his decision about my salary increase? /nA: Yeah, there's some updates, of course, I will let you know. /nT: Thank you for your time.","A: Hi, what did you want to talk about? Is there a problem relating to your work?/nT: Um, not exactly. I wanted to discuss with you about my salary and position in the job./nA: Do you have a question related to your salary or position in the job?/nT: so recently have been showing a lot of. I've been helping out the company a lot uh have won a lot of employee awards I have had the highest productivity rate in the office last year and i thought i deserved maybe an increase in salary /nA: yeah i do agree that you did a great job in past few years and i also enjoyed working with you uh but i hope you understand that increase in salary is a pretty serious complicated process and i can’t decide it by myself /nT: um you would you have to go to your higher ups to discuss about it /nA: yeah and that is one aspect, there are many factors we need to think about. /nT:  is there any way i could contact your higher-ups and discuss all my achievements and accomplishments to show them that i've achieved what i believe is enough to earn a higher salary /nA: Why do you need a salary increase at this time point? /nT: i personally just believe i deserve it also coming to this job i expected expected to achieve a higher salary within after a couple of years and that hasn’t been shown yet /nA: Yeah, I can understand that, I think we're a really great company, and then we have a very promising future. I really will have a great development, the future. So if you're keeping working with us, i personally enjoyed working with you. And if you're working with us in the future, i believe you're having an increase in salary. But i have to say, this can obviously it would be such a short period of time. /nT: Can you just let me know if there's any progress in that situation? /nA: It may take a while, but I will give you updates. /nT: Ok, thank you very much. ","A: Why did you want to talk today?/nT: Yeah, i just wanted to see how you were doing, and while  i ran into you. I just want to talk about our group project. Have you been giving any thought at all? /nA: I’ve been pretty busy because I am graduating this summer. /nT: Yeah, so i think we're doing okay. But a lot of us are taking on a lot more work than we can kind of handle. We know that you're very busy, but we were just maybe, if we could all meet up again and maybe talk about dividing the tasks up just to keep each other accountable, and i don't mind shoulder a little bit of extra work. But i think because you're able to come to the meetings, maybe at least trying to do some work and kind of stay engaged in the meetings/nA: I may not be able to show up every time we meet, but you could assign tasks to me online and I could work on them. I could also contribute notes. /nT: that was great. Great. You could contribute those notes that there may be a little bit about outside research. And then i think just your general contributions, like in our meetings, would be really helpful. /nA: I cannot do the fundamental work like coding or outside research. /nT: That would be helpful. I think just something that kind of balance the workload would be nice, just a little bit more. /nA: How do you want to split the work?/nT: i mean, since there's four of us. I mean, it would Be nice if we could do like a twenty five percent split all the way. /nA: You can write down tasks that I can do and we can schedule a meeting with our advisor, so I could be the link between the group and the advisor. /nT: Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that's a good connection, that sounds good, so we'll just make sure we have very clear tasks. And then if you can't make a meeting that's fine, but we can move forward from there. ","Go no prison. /nT: Hey, how’s it going?/nA: Good, so what did you want to see me about?/nT: I was hoping to have an open conversation about, potentially having an increase in my salary. What ? /nA: You know in our company we have, like a standard procedure, so if you want to have an increase in your salary or get a promotion you can go to system and apply for apply for applications have you heard of it? /nT: I have not done that yet. I was hoping to approach you directly, to potentially expedite the  process or increase my chances of getting the pay raise./nA:  Could you explain some details about why we should consider you for a raise about your performance and your work ethic in the last three months /nT: so i've won several employees of the month awards I moved out to china, of my own accord, to try to, increase my position in this company and to show how dedicated I am to the company. I have earned the highest productivity rate in this past year, and i have filled in for higher management numerous times. Based on my current salary and my current job requirements. I believe i've exceeded them, therefore should compensated more for my work. /nA: Yeah, so. Imagine we are increasing your compensation, could you please give me a number a rate, like ten percent, what is the desired level /nT: Ideally, i would have fifteen percent, pay increase. That is what I am looking for. /nA: So have you been receiving any offers from any companies recently. /nT: Um, at the moment, i have not been I have not been looking for other offers. As i would still like to work for this company /nA: So you want to stay with this company? So as I can tell you, you have spent like three years in our group and your performance is way above the average. So I do think you have potential for a raise, I recommend first that you go to the system and apply for a raise application and secondly, I want to talk about, so you just came to my office and talked about a raise, but what are you expecting, like You want me to pull some strings for you or just wanted me to refer you, because I am just one level higher So to be honest with you, i don't have the right to say. I don't have the final decision for the salary, all I can do is to refer to my supervisor. I can show him your Performance education. /nT: Um, okay, i could go fill out the application in the system. I understand your position only being one step about mine i do appreciate you recognizing the value i put into this company? If if you can, if you have the time and are willing, if you could refer me to your supervisors, i would really appreciate that. /nA: Yeah, i just wanted to say, i am not the final person to make the decision and another thing that is interesting our Committee is going to have extra advertising assignments in like two weeks, so, no, we're going to do low level steps to assign in our company advertising workers So is it's, not the job, you guys, should do but are you willing to spend like two or three days to help us in this advertising. /nT: I would be willing, to, help out in that in that exercise. /nA: Yeah, i should willing this extra work doesn’t give you compensation. That you are willing to do that for/nT: I understand I am not provided compensation. However, i am still dedicated this company. I want to see the company succeed i would like to succeed in the company. i want to do whatever i can to help this company./nA:  Just just to be clear, you are not interested in a move, you know, looking for any offers /nT: at this moment, no, however, I do understand my own value, and if the company does not recognize that in the near future, then i might potentially move but at the moment, i'm not. I would like to stay at the company /nA: So I can promise you that I will refer to my supervisors this week and get back to you and you should definitely apply in the system. /nT: okay, that will work","A: Good morning./nT: good morning, /nA: what do you want to talk about? /nT: nothing much, sir. Um, i just think i want to talk to you about just discuss something really simple. I want to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Why should we increase your salary?/nT: Yes, of course. You know, i've been working closely with you for the past three years since i moved over here and were able to give this amazing opportunity for me to grow and develop my career, which i would like to thank you so much. And not only work but also lead many other projects, i'm bring a lot of business for the company and do really well with it, and I’ve also taken up a lot of extra work that was necessary assigned to me just so that i can do what's best for out company./nA: We have a standard procedure, to apply for a raise. Why did you not apply for a raise in the system? /nT: like you said, you can ask almost anyone in the office, I am always working very hard and for those reasons. I have applied for the raise but they've never been completely approved. And that's. Why i want to talk to you specifically, obviously because I’ve worked so closely with you and you have seen me grow over the years, to see what could be the reasons for that. /nA: I’m your direct supervisor, and you have not received a response. You are very productive, and you have been very dedicated. Have you received offers from other companies?/nT: Oh, i mean, specifically from our company. Got in. I'm employed a month over and over again. So that kind of awards from us to see that i have been getting good work done and expanding our business to other places. /nA: Have you considered moving to another company. /nT: For me, when i obviously when I moved to china and coming to work at this office, my goal was getting kind of continue on with our company. I wasn't planning on jumping for one company to another, and i wanted to stick with us. And help grow myself and my career, as well as use that help our company grow to be the best that it could be/nA:  How much do you want for the raise?/nT: I think that i've been working for three, full years now and have gone above and beyond, so i was hoping that i would be able to get a fifteen to twenty percent raise. /nA: There is an opportunity to do advertising work next week, would you take extra work?/nT: Yeah, of course, i would be ready to kind of do anything that cos obviously, like expertise, people and other things that could help bring more. All represented, kind of like being in a panel showing how it's been such a great experience working here how much I have learned from it. But again, i would do pretty much anything that there needs to be done in order to help our company out and let it grow /nT: Do you want me to pull strings? Why do you want my help?/nA: I think that obviously, just since we've been working together and that you are my boss for the past three years, i think people also very professional are also very good personal relationship, that we're good friends, and that i always look up to you and see you as someone who is a great leader and someone who can always help me out in any case. So with that, i was hoping that you would be able to put a referral or just kind of help out in the process, simply because i know you've seen me work. You've seen what my value is for the company and also since we have such a great relationship, I thought it would be a good idea to speak to you./nA: I don’t have the ability to approve the raise, but I can refer you to the supervisors and get back to you./nT: yes, of course, like I tried to go through the normal channels, as well and everything, and i was hoping that even though you're just one level above me, we've seen that you obviously to do so much for the company, you have your own influence and things like that, and since obviously again, it's up to you. But as you've seen me work kind of with you over the past few years, i just thought that you could also continue to fight expedite the process, because, obviously, like all the rest of the process is important. I feel like i've kind of been through that kind of led me astray to nowhere, so that you could kind of just, like, help me out. ","A: Come on in, what do you want to talk to me about today?/nT:  i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Why do you think that you should receive a raise?/nT: done a lot of good things for this company. I have led many projects, brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me. /nA: It seems that you have done some of the same things that your colleges have been doing, so why do you specifically need to get a raise?/nT: I can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple of months. I believe that they re very impressed. /nA: Okay, so you need to give me some details and convince me that you're really good at your work. /nT: I take i worked the extra hours i have taken on roles that weren't necessarily assigned to me. I have tried my gone out of my way to learn the upper management's job and like to see if i can. I guess kind of like emulate. Um, even if i could, like, learn how to do and they believe that i would be like a great fit for the role. I think i could have gone above and beyond in the past. Um, and i believe that, like, i would be a strong candidate for an upper level job or even a higher salary because i have shown the work and, like, i had to have the work ethic in the productivity for it. /nA: We have a system for people to request raises, why did you come to see me?/nT: I think that any interaction is better face to face and thought that we could talk about, um, if i could get a raise. And if not, then like, what i can do to improve in the workplace. And then, like, i just wanted some, like, um, like. Constructive feedback from you /nA: Our company does not have enough budget for a raise, but what if we give a few more days off or something. /nT: i mean i like know that you’re the person with the final say on if someone gets a raise or not/nA: I’m not, but I can give the higher-level people suggestions and input. /nT:  so as like a lower level worker here i've seen a lot of resources that have gone to waste on how we can better fix our budget if i work with you closely on how we can fix our budget do you think then you will be able to find space in the budget to increase my salary /nA: What can you do to contribute to the company’s future. /nT: i would like some upward mobility in this company and as a higher level management worker i think i would be a great leader i have strong speaking skills people always respect me and my work ethic i i always show up i rarely ever take a day off and i will always be there for this company rain or shine. /nA: You made a lot of contributions to the company, I will be in contact with upper management to see what we can do with your request. /nT: Thank you.","A: Yeah come on in. What do you want to talk with me today? /nT: Uh yes i actually wanted to discuss something important with you regarding my future and present in the company and i was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary/nA:  So you want to increase your salary? Why do you think you deserve a raise ? /nT: Um well because i believe that i have done a lot of helpful things for the company and for my team i have led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that wasn't necessarily a part of my role but i took the initiative to go above and beyond and i've even filled in for higher management numerous times which has given me a lot of exposure and something that's higher than my job /nA: okay, so all right say would what do you think you can contribute to our company in the future? /nT: I think that my past record speaks for the future as well i'm a hard worker i'm driven and my passion for my my passion for my career also has to do with the company if the company does better i know that i will benefit from it as well so i always strive to do things that will help better my team, my company and my career as a whole /nA: Sounds like you’ve done a lot of jobs, but i think your colleagues have done the same things as you did so probably you can give me some other reasons like why you deserve a raise yeah you need to convince me /nT: well i'm not sure what the other employees have done and i can't speak on their behalf i can show you that what i've been working on and that's a two fold answer one is in the numbers and you can see that i've won numerous employee of the month awards i've earned the highest productivity rate in the office for last year and like i said earlier have i filled in for higher management numerous times whatever it's needed and that's more of the numbers part of it and stuff that you can see right away the more qualitative to part of that is that i believe that the people i work with whether it be my direct managers whether it be people below me or whether it be my co workers can really see the passion in time and effort i've put into this company and to really have a raise would incentivize me to do even better and to grow even more and be more successful along what making the company more successful aswell/nA:  it sounds reasonable but like i say what if like from what i know i think probably we don't have enough budget for you know give you a raise. I know that you do a lot of contribution to come, but probably we can’t give you a raise because probably we don't have enough budget, but probably we can give you several days off instead of give you budget, what do you think about that? /nT: Um, of course, anything would be appreciated since, like i said, i would love to have a little bit of, uh, incentive for all the work that i do put it to this company. And if you do happen to have some leeway a little bit of leeway with the budget, i promise you that what you i will be an investment to the company. What you end up spending on me ? I will work as hard as I can. Like i said, earlier numbers and inequality to earn back twice, three times four times as much for the company itself through my contracts. /nA: So i know i'm cannot make a decision on your request. I just your contact with the upper management to talk about your  request and would you want to talk with them? /nT: Yeah, i would love to talk to that. I can show them all the work that i've been doing these past couple of months. And hopefully i believe they would be very impressed. /nA: Ok sure/nT: Thank you so much, thanks.","A: Hello, come in. Why do you want to talk with me today? Is there a problem?/nT: no sir actually I wanted to discuss something with you i was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary/nA: Why do you feel you deserve a raise?/nT: over the past three years i felt like i've kind of gotten stock a little bit in the company despite i mean i've won a couple employee of the month awards had the highest productivity rate in the office last year and i filled in for higher management numerous times i really feel like i deserve this raise /nA: yeah i have seen your work and ever since you entered the outcome you have the perfect job in your position. Everyone in our company has a chance to get a raise. I will have to check with the upper management because I do not have the authority to make the final decision. I cannot give you a raise just because you think you deserve one. It depends on others’ evaluations./nT: I understand that, sir. In your opinion, is there anything that i could work on to improve my standing any more and potentially help help me get over the hump /nA: Maybe you can have a talk with upper management, but I will talk to them first to see what their feedback is. One thing I want to make clear is that even if your request is approved, it may take several months to get the raise. /nT: I totally get it. I mean, i enjoy working here, so i'm not going to be leaving. /nA: I’m glad that's you are happy to work here. Do you have any plans to move to another company?/nT:  that's a tough question, because it has been three years, and i'm definitely going to keep working my best. I always do. Um, if i feel like, you know, maybe it's not going to be right away, but in, like, a year or two, in a couple of years, you know how it is. If i feel like i can earn a little bit of a bump up in pay somewhere else, i might have to take that opportunity. I've got a family, you understand how that is? /nA: Yeah, i understand that, and thanks for your honesty Well, i try my best to support you in your request. I hope this will not effect your work during this time. /nT: Absolutely not.  Thank you for listening to appreciate it. ","A: Hello, come in, why do you want to meet with me today?/nT: i actually wanted to talk to you about something i was hoping to open a conversation with you about, potentially, increasing my salary. /nA: Why do you want to get a pay raise?/nT: well, i've been working here for a while, and i've done a lot of great things for the company. I've been in charge of a lot of projects, brought in a lot of business, and i've taken a lot of on a lot of extra work that wasn't necessarily my job. /nA: I have seen your work ethic, but I have to talk to the upper management to see if we can give you a pay raise. /nT: I understand. I can show them my work i've been doing, and i think that would be very impressed. /nA: There is a standard process in our company to get a pay raise, you can apply online. Why do you want to talk with me in person? /nT: Okay, that sounds very fair. I just thought it would be important to bring up to you before so you could vouch for me, as you've seen my work done around the office, and maybe that give me potentially more benefit in applying online/nA: I don’t have the authority to make a final decision, but I can make some recommendations for you to the upper management. What will you do if your requirement is not approved?/nT: Um, i'll continue working hard, and i'll try talking to other leaders around the office that could also vouch for me. I could communicate with the hr department, try to show them the work i've done. /nA: Thanks for your work, remember that after you submit your application, there will be some evaluation methods. You may be asked to do extra work, so will you do this? /nT: okay, it's, part of my job I guess, so I’d be willing to do that. /nA: Have you received offers from other companies?/nT: I have not, because i genuinely enjoyed working here, and i think that i could do some great things for this company. /nA: It may take several months to get a pay raise, even if your request is approved. I will talk with the upper management. I hope you can still work hard during this time. /nT: Thank you so much for meeting with me today.","A: So why do you want to meet with me today ? /nT: Oh, hi. I was hoping to talk to you about something. I just wanted to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing in my salary. /nA: So why do you think you deserve that?/nT: Um, well, i've been at this company for a long time for three years, and i haven't received a pay raise and all three of these years. Um, i believe that i have done really good work in this company. I put in a lot of effort on, and i think that results speak for themselves. I've won employee of the month awards numerous times. I have the highest productivity rate for the office in the last year, and i filled in for upper management several times. So i do believe that i am doing a lot of good work here and that i'm deserving of a raise. /nA: But I think so far you did just reasonable work in your position, and I think it is just like your other colleagues did. It doesn’t mean you deserve a raise. /nT: i think that i do more than my colleagues who are in the same position. I've also been here for a longer time. So i have more experience. Um, and i think that if you just look at, you know, my employment records, or if you look at your feedback from my managers, that you'll see that i've done above and beyond what a regular worker does here/nA: As you probably know, we have a system too, you know, for people to send you a request for anything including request for raises. Why did you decide to talk with me. /nT: Oh, um, i guess i just wanted to give you a heads up. And i knew that you would have a lot of influence on that. I guess I will just apply for that./nA: What do you think you can bring to the company in the future/nT: Um, i think that i will definitely continue. To, keep up the word work. I think that i've been keeping now. I definitely think i could bring more customers. And i think that in the future, i have the ability to do really well, in a higher management position get. I understand the vision of the company well, and we'll be able to lead it and do better things for the future/nA:  So what if I  give you some extra work, or exceptional work, would you be willing to do that?/nT: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think that that's, always something that I’m looking for, more opportunities to prove myself/nA: I probably don’t have the final say about your request, I probably need to talk with the upper management, because I’m just one level higher than you. So probably I need to ask whether a position. are you willing to talk with them?/nT: Yeah, absolutely. Um, and i just tell them everything that I’ve told you. I think bring in my work records and they will speak for themselves.","A: Hello, come in, what do you want to talk to me about today, is there a problem with your work?/nT: No, sir, i actually wanted to discuss something with you. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary. /nA: Why do you want a raise? /nT: Yes, i have done a lot of good things for the company. I have led many projects, brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me./nA:  I don’t have the authority to give you a pay raise, I need to talk to the upper management. /nT:  i can show them all the work i have been doing over the past couple of months. I believe they would be very impressed.  /nA: We have a standard process for requesting a pay raise, have you ever submitted an application in the system? /nT: No I haven’t /nA: I will support your application for a pay raise, but I do not have the authority to make the final decision. What if your application is not approved. /nT: Well, thank you for your help. And i appreciate your support. And if i do not get approved, are there any other options, that I can reapply or do something else, to Essentially get a raise./nA: Keep working hard, and make less mistakes, if you make a great contribution, if you make mistakes it will be harder to get a pay raise. You can apply again the next time. /nT: I’ll try that, that sounds great. /nA: Even if your request is approved, it will take several months to take effect.  There will be an evaluation of progress, and you may be asked to do extra work. /nT: Ok, that sounds great. /nA: Do you receive offers from other companies? /nT:  Yes, yeah, and i have received offers from other companies. So i want to, uh, keep the honor of this company and ask for a pay raise before i considered the other option./nA: Did the other companies give you a higher salary offer?/nT:  uh, yes, currently they have offered me a higher salary. /nA: What will you do if a salary increase is not increased? /nT: I will talk the other offer. /nA: I appreciate the honesty and I will talk to my supervisors about the situation. /nT: Thank you. ","A: Hi, why do you want to meet, is there a problem with your work?/nT: No, um, i just wanted to talk about my current status. Um, i think the i was hoping to have a conversation about potentially salary. /nA: Why do you want to ask at this point? /nT: i've been doing, a lot of good work for the company over the past years. I've led a lot of projects subbed in for higher level management when you guys were busy with something else, I brought business for the company. And so I think because of all those things I deserve a better thing./nA: Other employees have also worked hard and increasing salary is a complicated process. /nT:  Uh, yeah, but at the same time, i think that, if you ask anyone in the office based on the fact that I’ve gotten so many employee of the month awards in the past, that I would deserve an increase in my salary and it’s been a few years not. /nA: I have to talk to with higher level management, and it may take a few months to make this decision. /nT: I think that’s fine, as long as you also see where I’m coming from and why I think I deserve a higher salary. /nA:  Would you consider changing companies if we cannot increase your salary? /nT: Perhaps, I’m pretty dedicated to this company, and I’ve been working hard, but I would like to stay at this company. ","A: Hi, why would you like to meet with me today? Is there a problem with your work?/nT: No, ma’am, i actually wanted to discuss something. I was hoping to have an open conversation with you about potentially raising my salary./nA: Ok, why are you asking for a salary increase at this time?/nT: I've done a lot of good things for the company. I have led many extra, many projects, that brought in a lot of business with the company. And i've taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me./nA: You did a great job, and many other colleges have also worked hard and  it is a complicated process. /nT: Well, i can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple of months. I believe they'd be pretty impressed. /nA: I am willing to ask upper level management about increasing your salary, but it may take a few months. /nT: I understand that. I just wanted to have honest conversation with you about my standing in the company and about how i feel about the work. /nA: If you cannot get a salary increase would you consider leaving the company. /nT: I think i would, because of the extent of work i've been doing. But i also understand if, for some extraordinary reason you would not be able to do it, i would understand if it were a real reason for that./nA: Okay, thank you for saying that, uh, we actually are really enjoying working with you, and i hope you believe that we are company with a promising future/nT: All right, if you could just keep keep in touch and let me know how all that's going on. ","A: Hi come in, what do you want to discuss with me today. /nT: I was just wondering if we could discuss about if I could get a pay raise? I haven't mentioned in a long time, but since being with the company for very long and just rising through the company, I thought it was time. With family expenses, rising and me not making as much, I thought this would be the most opportune time to request a pay raise. /nA: Why do you deserve a pay raise?/nT: According to my awards, as or recently over the past few years i've been employee of the month several times, I’ve had the highest productivity rate in the office last year, and I’ve also been taking on tasks that weren’t necessarily assigned to me, so based on these credentials, I thought I should deserve a pay raise./nT: But it sounds like you did the same jobs as your colleges./nA: Like I mentioned earlier though, I have been taking on the tasks of my colleges, who are not necessarily doing their work.  I’m taking on more than my colleges. Do you see what I’m saying?/nA: So you did extra work?/nT: Basically/nA: What would you bring to the company in the future? /nT: I came in with the intention of working my way up but recently my position has been very stagnant, there have not been many opportunities to grow within the company. I’m not saying I have to rise up on the ladders, or anything like that, but a small pay raise would be great./nA: Would you be willing to do extra work?/nT: I would be more than willing to do that. I don’t mind anything as long as I can like possibly get a pay raise, I would be more than down to help the company out as much as I can. /nA: What if I ask you to do extra work?/nT: I would be willing. /nA: I don’t think we can give you a raise, but we could give you several days off, what do you think about that?/nT: Maybe to compensate for it, instead of getting a raise, we can have vacation days, compensated vacation days. So it’s not necessarily a raise but it’s like a paid expense trip. /nA: We have a system for requests for salary increases. Why did you decide to talk to me? /nT: I thought you would be the ideal person to talk to about this just because you are my boss, you are in charge of pay roll and everything/nA: I need to contact upper management, they are in change of salary, would you be willing to talk to them?/nT: Yeah of course, I just though I should let you know and see your opinion first. ","A: Why did you want to meet with me today, is there a problem relating to your work? /nT:  No, i actually wanted to discuss. I was hoping to have a conversation with you about potentially increasing my salary./nA:  Okay but  why do you want an increase in salary at this time. /nT: Um, i have done a lot of good things. Led many projects, brought in a lot of business for the company, and have taken on a lot o of extra work that has not been assigned to me./nA: Yes, i believe you did a great job. I have to say, there are many other people working hard, and this is a complicated process. /nT: no it's, fine. There, you're going to show from all the work that i've been doing over the past couple months. You can ask anyone the office, including upper management about my work. I think that you would find that i work hard. Or that I have good, good work ethic. /nA: I believe that you work hard, but it may take a few months, can you wait that long./nT: Yeah. So whatever works around your schedule. /nA: If we cannot increase your salary in the end, will you consider moving to another company?/nT: I might have to start looking for another job at that point. /nA: I enjoy working with you and our company has a promising future, and I hope we can still work with you if the salary increase does not do through. /nT: Thank you for saying that, and thank you for your time.
