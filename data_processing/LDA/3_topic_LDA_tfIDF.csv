That would be amazing. But i would be perfectly content just increasing my current salary with my current position as well.  ~  Well, i mean, i think all of my past work has definitely shown that and you said that based on the results of my work. I think if we look back in the books projects i have worked on, i believe they are more than up to par when considering a raise. So i believe that shows that i earned it. "

"18",0.271929824561404,0.390350877192982,0.337719298245614,2," Yeah, that would be i was going to ask you if you'd be willing to do that. And, um, lobby for my case, i would really appreciate that.  ~  Yeah, well, we i think that it's important that you discuss it with you you need to discuss it with now but you and i can discuss it later.

I feel like i've done a lot of good work for the company in the past year, especially, and having been here for three years, i've done a lot of work to lead many projects and brought a lot of good business to the company. So i felt like i've taken on a lot of extra work and I deserve the raise."
"23",0.381642512077295,0.374396135265701,0.243961352657005,1," Um, well, i felt like i can show them all the work, and i could tell them all the things that i've done.

Um, in fact, i feel like you could ask anyone in the office, including upper management, about my work ethic. And i believe that i worked harder than almost anyone.  ~  what aren't you the one who has the final say? i don't understand why we would why you would need to discuss this with upper management. like i said earlier, you could ask anyone in the office including upper management about my work ethic and i think they definitely back me ~  i understand i understand and i definitely i respect that, but i just think that i'm asking to just think about raising the salary considering that i've been working here for three years, i've never had any problems i've won numerous employee of the month awards as well as earning the highest productivity rate in the office last year and considering that i have filled in for higher management numerous times, i believe that the current salary i have doesn't reflect accurately what i'm capable of doing, "
"29",0.26984126984127,0.341269841269841,0.388888888888889,3," I would definitely wouldn't say it's very urgent, but i would i would appreciate if we could just get get it into the talks and just thinking about, like, raising my salary, considering i've been working for the past three years, maybe, like, on my fourth year of working, i would expect, not expect, but i would appreciate ah, higher raise a raise.

"31",0.275555555555556,0.342222222222222,0.382222222222222,3," No, because i definitely think, considering the way how open you are, of discussing the possibility of a raise that i could come back next year or the year after that. And try to, you know, discuss the higher salary when the future, when the company is going to be doing much better. And when i will be more much more experienced than too "

I was thinking about my role and position and involvement in the company, uh, was thinking about the work and the business that have provided in the past when the work that i continue to do today, um, i think that these things no. In my mind, are deserving of an increase in salary.  ~  Of course i understand. Well, i think that the multiple projects that i've been involved with, uh, all of which have been successful. I've been working here for three years. I think that that shows the level of dedication that i'm willing to give to this position and how much i care about this, uh, this company on my job, on the success that we've created together. And i personally would like to have a greater part in that. And i think that as i increase my involvement and as i, i dedicate myself more that  calls for an increase to salary. "

Well, i like to think that that my passport, a good indicator for how i worked today and how i will choose to work tomorrow. And i think that if my level of commitment was at a certain level, as i increase that level of commitment, i think i would like to see compensation without moving forward. And i also recognize that's Not the only reason that i do this job, and i'm committed to of the position. Regardless, my pay.

What ?  ~  so i've won several employees of the month awards I moved out to china, of my own accord, to try to, increase my position in this company and to show how dedicated I am to the company. I have earned the highest productivity rate in this past year, and i have filled in for higher management numerous times. Based on my current salary and my current job requirements. I believe i've exceeded them, therefore should compensated more for my work. "
"55",0.28042328042328,0.35978835978836,0.35978835978836,2," I have not done that yet. I was hoping to approach you directly, to potentially expedite the  process or increase my chances of getting the pay raise."

I want to see the company succeed i would like to succeed in the company. i want to do whatever i can to help this company. ~  at this moment, no, however, I do understand my own value, and if the company does not recognize that in the near future, then i might potentially move but at the moment, i'm not. I would like to stay at the company "
"57",0.333333333333333,0.352201257861635,0.314465408805031,2," okay, that will work"

"60",0.419191919191919,0.297979797979798,0.282828282828283,1," so i thought that you would be the one who was eventually in charge of this but i could definitely go back to the upper management and show them the work i've been doing the past couple of months and i think that they would be impressed "
"61",0.480952380952381,0.280952380952381,0.238095238095238,1,"Right, so I’ve done a lot of good things for the company i've led many projects brought in a lot of business for the company and i've taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me"

I would be definitely willing to do that. I would love to go through the entire process if there's a formal process for doing this. ~  so i guess that is up to them. In the end, i would understand that if they go through the process and evaluate me and they do not think that i deserve that that's understandable.  ~ Um, i think i would go to them and pitch Why, i think i do deserve this pay raise, and I personally believe that i do, and so i wouldn’t completely understand it. But in the end, it is their decision, "
"63",0.304964539007092,0.326241134751773,0.368794326241135,3,"Um, i think i would go to them and pitch Why, i think i do deserve this pay raise, and I personally believe that i do, and so i wouldn’t completely understand it. But in the end, it is their decision,  ~  Um, i'm not actively looking for other companies, and i'm very committed to the company. And so i don't think that whether or not i get a pay raise will affect my level of work.  ~  Well, i have been very committed to the company. Obviously, i've been here for the past few years. Three years yes, and i would love to be able to stay with company. So primarily i would try to do that. "

I think that you've been a good boss to me. And i have no reason to doubt that you would give me anything less than what you feel is appropriate.  ~  i looked into it, but i think that something that i've always been told is you want something, you should go straight to the person and talk to them. "
"66",0.304029304029304,0.413919413919414,0.282051282051282,2," i just i think that i know you to be fair. And i know you to be somebody who's going to reward hard work. I think that i'm served this company well. And i think that at this point, i just i'm really looking for maybe higher wage or something to let it be recognized that I have been working hard.  ~  I just think that with some of the accolades that I have received in this past year, maybe it's, just time for me, move a little bit higher in the ranks, "
"67",0.245833333333333,0.495833333333333,0.258333333333333,2," That makes total sense and that's, definitely something that i'm interested in and having you do it's, just maybe about you coming one level higher. I think that it’s definitely valued. And i think that me filling out an official form will not go as far. You actually going one level higher up and just talking for me personally. "
"68",0.297619047619048,0.369047619047619,0.333333333333333,2," That's a good question. Two days, with no conversation at all. "

"70",0.289617486338798,0.371584699453552,0.33879781420765,2," Yes, i think that if you give me your word that you're going to, try to do all that. I could definitely see myself doing this is taking on a little more responsibility. "
"71",0.322404371584699,0.322404371584699,0.355191256830601,3," Well, i just considered. Since you're the boss, you would know you the authority to give me a pay raise. "

While i'm really grateful for being able to work here for the past three years and an excellent boss. I think that i've displayed a lot of leadership, good work ethic, doing things haven't really been assigned to me, and i think that based on those. I could really use a pay raise. "
"73",0.339393939393939,0.321212121212121,0.339393939393939,1," Then, in that case, do you think you could speak to him on my approval on my behalf? "

You said yourself that, you know, i worked really hard with your, you know, recommendation. I think that would go a long way with upper management. "
"75",0.291079812206573,0.431924882629108,0.276995305164319,2," No, you think, you know, if it's not approved i would just come back and ask why, but I don't want to infringe on your job, because you know you're more connected, to upper management than i am, but i'd still, like to pursue that as much as possible. "

I believe they will be very impressed.  ~  I believe I have gone above and beyond in my role as an employee here and a lot of people can attest to that and i think i brought a lot of success to the company, which is why i deserve a raise after three years. ~  Yeah, i could contact them, but i prefer it if you could also put in your word based on my work. "
"81",0.373737373737374,0.313131313131313,0.313131313131313,1," in the future, with the higher managerial role, i will be able to further the success by controlling more employees, more divisions of the company, and hopefully bring better outlook for the future. "

"85",0.312312312312312,0.33033033033033,0.357357357357357,3," like you said, you can ask almost anyone in the office, I am always working very hard and for those reasons. I have applied for the raise but they've never been completely approved. And that's. Why i want to talk to you specifically, obviously because I’ve worked so closely with you and you have seen me grow over the years, to see what could be the reasons for that.  ~  Oh, i mean, specifically from our company. Got in. I'm employed a month over and over again. So that kind of awards from us to see that i have been getting good work done and expanding our business to other places.  ~  I think that i've been working for three, full years now and have gone above and beyond, so i was hoping that i would be able to get a fifteen to twenty percent raise.

But as you've seen me work kind of with you over the past few years, i just thought that you could also continue to fight expedite the process, because, obviously, like all the rest of the process is important. I feel like i've kind of been through that kind of led me astray to nowhere, so that you could kind of just, like, help me out. "
"87",0.354700854700855,0.367521367521368,0.277777777777778,2," For me, when i obviously when I moved to china and coming to work at this office, my goal was getting kind of continue on with our company.

All represented, kind of like being in a panel showing how it's been such a great experience working here how much I have learned from it. But again, i would do pretty much anything that there needs to be done in order to help our company out and let it grow "

I've been doing not only my own work, but i've been do, like more work than has been assigned to me, and i feel that it's all been very, very well done. You always really appreciated everything. And so i was just thinking that after a long time and for the value that i bring, i think that a pay raise is appropriate at this time. "
"91",0.298449612403101,0.414728682170543,0.286821705426357,2," i didn't do it yet, but i can write that letter if that's what's needed  ~  Um, well, after so many years, i feel that i request that this point is usually normal to happen, so it doesn't happen. Then i might want t,. I don't know. I was my direct manager that i was hoping that you'd be able to have a little more influence and maybe trying to accomplish that raise after such a long time of being here, "

I have led many projects, brought in a lot of business for the company and have taken a lot of extra work that was not assigned to me.  ~  I can show them all the work i've been doing over the past couple of months. I believe that they re very impressed.  ~  I take i worked the extra hours i have taken on roles that weren't necessarily assigned to me. I have tried my gone out of my way to learn the upper management's job and like to see if i can. I guess kind of like emulate. Um, even if i could, like, learn how to do and they believe that i would be like a great fit for the role. I think i could have gone above and beyond in the past. Um, and i believe that, like, i would be a strong candidate for an upper level job or even a higher salary because i have shown the work and, like, i had to have the work ethic in the productivity for it.  ~  i mean i like know that you’re the person with the final say on if someone gets a raise or not ~  so as like a lower level worker here i've seen a lot of resources that have gone to waste on how we can better fix our budget if i work with you closely on how we can fix our budget do you think then you will be able to find space in the budget to increase my salary  ~  i would like some upward mobility in this company and as a higher level management worker i think i would be a great leader i have strong speaking skills people always respect me and my work ethic i i always show up i rarely ever take a day off and i will always be there for this company rain or shine.

I was hoping to talk about our group project with you. There is some problems we need a fix right now.  ~  The group and i feel like we have a lot of work to shoulder, and we're hoping that you'd be able to take on some more work.  ~  i know you're probably really busy preparing for graduation, but it be great if you could accomplish some tasks being a senior, your expertise and, like your knowledge, were go really long way in helping us finish this project ~  But we felt like you haven't put a lot into this project and we will we won't be able to finish his project if you don't get this work done i think we won't be able to graduate if we don't pass this project so i think we need a little more help from your end  ~  so maybe just like when we have like some questions and you keep missing some of our group meeting so just trying to attend the group meetings or like responding to some of our messages would really help us see where you're at and what t we can ask you for help and if you could help us back  ~  yeah so we notice you're really busy but we want have a chance to be able to work on the project we think you have some like great insight and a lot of stuff on what we're doing so it's been really hard tio keep up with the project because the full team hasn't been here  ~  Yeah so i think that's good, but i think still, i think you need to put in like, a little effort, because this is like a group project so just like putting in a little time, like we all know you're busy. And a lot of us are too just taking a little time out of your day to work on this project would really help us move along in the project."
"101",0.226299694189602,0.574923547400612,0.198776758409786,2," i think if we have like four people then like we can have more brains attacking like some problems because being like a sophomore like i don't have much knowledge as you might have to input on the project and show us like the proper direction to go for this project ~  yeah i think like calling in or like via skype just your presence being at the meeting i think we really helped us with that if we have any issue that you might be able to help us like fix that you're right you're like nearby and easy to contact so that we can continue working on this project and that you have like a little input throughout the meetings"
"102",0.232704402515723,0.572327044025157,0.19496855345912,2," Yeah, i think that's a pretty good idea. So i can just, like, check in with you to make sure that, like you, like, you're still technically the leader because the professor assigned you to be the leader so like checking up with you. That, like, what we're doing, is looking in the right direction and that. Like, i'm not taking the group in the wrong direction, making sure that you're also staying involved. So i think assigning me the leader role is okay. But i still think you should. be making the final decisions, because at the end of the day, you're the leader. I'm just the one that you gave some of the work to"
"103",0.301075268817204,0.365591397849462,0.333333333333333,2," Yeah, i just wanted to see how you were doing, and while  i ran into you. I just want to talk about our group project. Have you been giving any thought at all? "

I think just something that kind of balance the workload would be nice, just a little bit more.  ~  i mean, since there's four of us. I mean, it would Be nice if we could do like a twenty five percent split all the way. "
"105",0.20959595959596,0.595959595959596,0.194444444444444,2," Yeah, so i think we're doing okay. But a lot of us are taking on a lot more work than we can kind of handle. We know that you're very busy, but we were just maybe, if we could all meet up again and maybe talk about dividing the tasks up just to keep each other accountable, and i don't mind shoulder a little bit of extra work. But i think because you're able to come to the meetings, maybe at least trying to do some work and kind of stay engaged in the meetings ~  that was great. Great. You could contribute those notes that there may be a little bit about outside research. And then i think just your general contributions, like in our meetings, would be really helpful.  ~  Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that's a good connection, that sounds good, so we'll just make sure we have very clear tasks. And then if you can't make a meeting that's fine, but we can move forward from there. "

Um, if i feel like, you know, maybe it's not going to be right away, but in, like, a year or two, in a couple of years, you know how it is. If i feel like i can earn a little bit of a bump up in pay somewhere else, i might have to take that opportunity. I've got a family, you understand how that is? "

I can show them my work i've been doing, and i think that would be very impressed.  ~  Okay, that sounds very fair. I just thought it would be important to bring up to you before so you could vouch for me, as you've seen my work done around the office, and maybe that give me potentially more benefit in applying online ~  Um, i'll continue working hard, and i'll try talking to other leaders around the office that could also vouch for me. I could communicate with the hr department, try to show them the work i've done.  ~  okay, it's, part of my job I guess, so I’d be willing to do that.  ~  I have not, because i genuinely enjoyed working here, and i think that i could do some great things for this company.

Um, i believe that i have done really good work in this company. I put in a lot of effort on, and i think that results speak for themselves. I've won employee of the month awards numerous times. I have the highest productivity rate for the office in the last year, and i filled in for upper management several times. So i do believe that i am doing a lot of good work here and that i'm deserving of a raise.  ~  i think that i do more than my colleagues who are in the same position.

I haven't mentioned in a long time, but since being with the company for very long and just rising through the company, I thought it was time.

I’m not saying I have to rise up on the ladders, or anything like that, but a small pay raise would be great. ~  I would be more than willing to do that. I don’t mind anything as long as I can like possibly get a pay raise, I would be more than down to help the company out as much as I can. "
