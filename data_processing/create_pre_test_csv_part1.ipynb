       " \"A: Okay, uh, what's problem. \",\n",
       " \"T: The group and i just feel that we have a lot to shoulder and we were hoping that you'd be able to take on some more work \",\n",
       " \"A: Um, ok here's a situation, I’m a fourth year student and really busy recently and i even need to apply for new graduate schools so i don't have enough time \",\n",
       " \"T: no right yeah some of us noticed that you've been pretty busy but we just wanted you to have a chance to be able to work on the project because we think you would have some good insight and it would be beneficial for all of us \",\n",
       " \"A: yeah i would like to but i don't have time to meet you every week or every time we meet. Do you have another solution?\",\n",
       " \"T: i mean well so you're saying you don't have time to meet right, but coming into this class you knew that there would be some sort of outside meeting requirements right and so that was described to you even before taking on this project which we all agreed to and from our understanding you are the senior of the group you are most respected individual in our group by the professor and so with that if anything the professor would be disappointed with not seeing your contributions if that makes sense \",\n",
       " \"A: yeah i understand that the score or something about assessment are very important to you but from my standing point, the score are not so important because i'm going to graduate but i would like to help you if you need any assistance and by the way i think if you can be the leader ofthe group project and will be a very good experience for you \",\n",
       " \"T: i agree completely but the roles have been designated already and so it would be insulting almost to the professor if we were to try to switch roles at this point considering the project is due so soon but i do understand that you are graduating you have a lot going on and so not meeting all the time is understandable but meeting the task that we all have to do is important so that we are able to finish the project in a respective manner because for my understanding if we don't finish this project well enough you won't actually be able to graduate \",\n",
       " \"A: yeah of course but uh maybe a higher score or a lower score that kind of gap is not so important what about this, we don't need to necessary change the conceptual role of the leader or something, maybe you can just do more work and i can review your work do you think that will work \",\n",
       " \"T: well considering that i've been putting in a lot more work along with my other, two group members and like the fact that the work that like we've been having a pick up your work it's not acceptable at this point and considering that we've already covered for you and we're still asking to let's just review the work isn't really acceptable so i would really appreciate if you could understand and try to meet us halfway and start picking up the slack from this point onwards \",\n",
       " \"A: so you mean that we cannot switching roles or like doing things another ways like I doing the review work you doing there like basic works do you think they're all not work which means i have to do like equally with you guys \",\n",
       " \"T: yeah i think i think would be best if we all put in equal work right because it's not that i'm as as the leader is not that because your leader you have to do more work for because i'm not leader i don't have to do more work it's we both have to put in equal work if anything you being leader you should be leading the way in terms of how much work we put in and how what expectations we should meet but like with the way we're going we're not even gonna be able to present in a well formatted way due to our you know, miscommunications and like are inattentiveness during the meetings you know \",\n",
       " \"A: yeah but what what we are doing now not reach a solution because you know i'm busy you're still asking me to squeeze my time to like dedicate more time on this project rather than just save my time to do it in an efficient way so i don't think this is applicable because i still don't have enough time. The time is a critical factor in this situation. \",\n",
       " \"T: I see your point. So do do you have any suggestions as to what we can do ? Because at this point, we're not where we need to be on the project, and the other team members and myself are trying as hard as we can, but we won't be able to make it without your contributions. \",\n",
       " 'A: Yeah, i think this scenarios might experience really is important. I suggest that we can, i can, do they review of your work. If you can write something, write a proposal, paper, or something, I can review it give some suggestion, and you can edit it later. You think that will work? ',\n",
       " \"T: Um not quite because this is a three thousand page three thousand word paper right and so it's actually very feasible if we do split it up by sections within the four people and so it would be best if you could try to contribute even like just put down your ideas you know because if it's a it's a factor of quality over quantity at this point and so if you can't, if you don't have much time then at least get your thoughts down and then we could flesh out the ideas and then if that's what you're talking about then and you can review it and see if that's what you wanted to include in that section \",\n",
